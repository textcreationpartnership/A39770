            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:61707:3"/> have heard of. Being ſo, I no ſooner read it, but I bleſſed <hi>it,</hi> and its unknown <hi>Author.</hi> Privately and publickly I praiſed it, and finding it not to be had in our <hi>Shops,</hi> nor but from <hi>Holland,</hi> (if from thence) to be gotten, I preſently reſolved to <hi>Reprint</hi> it. Soon after, hearing <hi>who</hi> was the Author, and <hi>where</hi> he was, I ſent him notice of that my fixed Reſolution, whether he conſented to it or no. For thus I argued; that if he were of the <hi>heavenly ſpirit</hi> breathing in his Book, he could not <hi>gainſay</hi> it; and if he were of <hi>another ſpirit,</hi> for the Churches ſervice, it would be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> and <hi>praiſe-worthy</hi> to croſs it. But bleſſed be God, and bleſſed be he from his Lord and mine, he readily <hi>forgave me this wrong,</hi> and cheerfully I proceeded.</p>
            <p>No <hi>Lion</hi> found I in my way; but a <hi>ſorry Worm</hi> I counted the Exclamations of ſome nice Folk, againſt the <hi>Phraſe</hi> and <hi>Style</hi> of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly excellent Work.

            <p>THings of unqueſtionable Excellence in themſelves, and of greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance unto our welfare, have not always the Deepeſt and moſt Conſtant Thoughts beſtown upon them. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Satisfaction of our Minds about the Matter, and about the Foundations of our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian Faith.</p>
            <p>It ſeems too little obſerved, but it can never be ſufficiently Lamented, what we do obſerve of Proteſtants neglect of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Faith. And yet our ſad Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence certifies us, that they are incomparably
<pb facs="tcp:61707:5"/> more heedleſs of acquainting themſelves with the Reaſons thereof. We have very many that do competently know, what it is to be a Chriſtian, for every ſingle man that can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Reaſon, why he ought to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Storms do make men look to their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors; and we do not know, but aweful Judgments are haſtning on us, (being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ones do not awaken us,) to beat us out of our inconſiderately choſen Refuges. Our Precarious and Unexamined Confidences, which in very Propriety are but Fancy, and not Faith built upon any ſolid Grounds. However, we muſt all, needs Die; and it is more than probable, that a near Proſpect of the Future State, may convincingly ſhow the moſt obſtinate, that the King of Terrours is not to be conquered, and no Miracles are to be wrought, by an Implicit Faith.<note place="margin">Pecudum ritu euntes non qà eundum eſt, ſed qà itur. <hi>Sen.</hi>
               </note> Or by a way of Religion, that is taken up and walk'd in, meerly for Company.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we give our great Thanks to the Author of every good Gift; who hath drawn this his richly furniſhed Scribe, to ſupply us with ſo very needful a Treatiſe as is here offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Some of us do Profeſs that in reading it, we were ſurprized with Joy and with Wonder, that a Topick ſo little Written, Diſcourſed,

            <head>The Author's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis ſmall Treatiſe here offered, is on the greateſt Subjects that can fall under the Conſideration of Mankind; and is a Study, which was never more preſſingly called for, than in theſe days, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Peace with God, and gaining ſuch an Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Truth, as may fully quiet and ſupport the Soul, though all ſenſible Props ſhould be broken, and fail, Great changes do ſurely haſten on this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the <hi>Life of Faith</hi> is in another manner like to be put to Tryal, than ſince the Churches Riſe and Recovery from <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Bondage. The storm now viſibly grows upon the Churches of Chriſt, though nothing ought to Faint or Shake the Spirits of any, who know their Anchor is ſure and caſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Vail; but the ſtrongeſt Difficulties, in following the Lord, (when overcome,) yeild the greateſt Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and will be not only matter of Joy here, but to all Eternity, in having with Patience and Hope indured, and got well through a Throng of Temptations and Aſſaults in a reſolute adherence to the Truth. If men think it their Wiſdom to ſecure their Private Intereſt, by dividing it in ſuch a time from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cauſe of the Reformed Church, and make Light of the greateſt Truths of God now aſſaulted, of the Blood of the Martyrs, yea of their own Eternal State, by any coolneſs or ſhrinking from the ſame; they will
<pb facs="tcp:61707:7"/> find no Temporal Motives, can ever compenſate that loſs and ruine which inevitably will meet ſuch in the Iſſue. Yea that theſe Words of <hi>Mordecai to Eſther,</hi> (Eſth. <hi>4.13, 14.</hi>) Have the ſame Voice, and weight in this day. What is held forth in the following work, I may with humble Confidence ſay, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome preſſure to have ſuch clear Evidence and Quieting Perſuaſion of Divine Truth, as made it leſs eaſie to have my own Spirit ſatisfied herein, than poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly it may be to others; for if it were not from that bleſſed Aſſurance of the Lords being God, of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Chriſt, and of the Glory to come, I ſhould not know what could be comforting, or make a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Being deſireable. Some ſingular Ingagements I judge my ſelf alſo to ſtand under, for putting to my Seal to the Truth and Faithfulneſs of God in his Word, from many ſignal Confirmations hereof in the courſe of my Pilgrimage, if ſuch a poor Teſtimony might be of any weight. Let the Bleſſed Lord, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly accept this ſmall offering to him, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his Truth, by ſo mean an Inſtrument, and give ſome Fruit hereof, that may abide, and be found in the day of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I hope the Reader may find by a Peruſal of the <hi>I.</hi> Chapter of what Serious Uſe and Intent the II. is, yea that in this day it was not Unſeaſonable or Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to the foregoing Subject what is held forth in the III. Chapter. But Oh! it is ſad and amazing to think how few are under that weight of Religion, as once to have a Serious Inquiry on the Grounds and Reaſons thereof, and to account the moſt ſpecial Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to their Faith to be the greateſt Helpers of their Joy within time.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Primitive Confirmation in the truth of Chriſtianity, held forth and cleared, in its continued neceſſity and uſe to this day, in ſeven Poſitions.</head>
               <p>Poſit. I. <hi>THAT nothing can be of a more ſad and threatning aſpect on the preſent ſtate of Religion in all the Churches of Chriſt, than that utter eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, moſt are under, to the true grounds of Faith, and to thoſe fundamental differences betwixt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and every falſe way, which no pretended Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion can lay claim to.</hi> The reaſons of the <hi>Poſition,</hi> are theſe. I. That it is too viſibly manifeſt, how no men in the world know ſo little of their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, of any human art or ſcience, as ſuch
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61707:10"/> who bear the Name of Chriſtians. Or are ſo generally ſtrangers to the Truth and firmneſs of the Principles thereof, for maintaining either a due Valuation, or powerful ſence of the ſame on their Soul; ſo that an implicit and <hi>Traditional Profeſſion</hi> is the only part and propriety which moſt can claim in the Truth, and Doctrine they profeſs. II. That very rarely alſo is any Serious Perſonal Inquiry and Tryal, if there be indeed ſuch a thing as an <hi>Experimental and Soul-quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Religion</hi> in the Earth. That can bear the expence of the moſt diſmal and afflicting times, and hath ſo great a temporal Revenue, as Peace with God, an Immediate Communion with him, the Joy and Comforts of the Holy <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> when we are under ſuch preſſures of trouble as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ſupport of Nature. III. That the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt account, why moſt go under the name of Chriſtians, rather than of any other form, can riſe no higher than Cuſtom and Education, that it did beſpeak them from their Birth, and was the Religion of their Anceſtors; yea become in that manner natural to them as the Cuſtoms and Language of their Country. Which are grounds that would determine to the very oppoſite Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if they were ſtated under the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and had the ſame motives to be <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans;</hi> ſince it is ſure theſe can found no other Aſſent, than is ſuitable to the Nature and Strength thereof. IV. That thus it is plain the moſt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous part of Viſible Profeſſours; are deſtitute of any defence from internal motives, and ſolid convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth they profeſs, upon its own evidence; and there was never more cauſe to fear, ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61707:10"/> apoſtacy from the very viſible profeſsion of Chriſt, upon any violent tryal and aſſault this way. When ſuch find it more eaſy to render up their Religion, than to adhere to the ſame, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtrong temptations, who yet never knew that ſubſtance, advantage, or certainty herein, as could preponderate with the want of all external motives for ſuch a profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Poſit. II. <hi>That thus one of the higheſt ſervices of theſe times, for the publick good of the Church, does convincingly lye here; to have</hi> the faith of aſſent <hi>to the truth and doctrine of Chriſt, in a clear and firm certainty of the judgment, on its own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, more vigorouſly promoted and the proper means and aſſiſtances, which the Lord hath given for this end, in ſome other manner yet improved, than ſeems to be at this day, for a more univerſal uſe.</hi> The grounds to inforce the neceſsity hereof are theſe; I. That it's ſure wherever the Goſpel is revealed to men, it comes with ſo full an aſſurance of underſtanding, and ſufficiency of objective evidence, as can admit of no poſsible doubtfulneſs herein. Which is the credit and glory of our religion, that in no other way it doth require acceptance, but with the furtheſt conviction of evidence. II. Becauſe the expreſs deſign and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this bleſſed revelation, is no leſs to found ſuch a rational aſſurance in the judgment, of its truth, than to ingage the will and conſent, for imbracing thereof; and though ſuch great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations for this end can only, <hi>in ſuo genere,</hi> have a convincing influence to perſwade the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, yet are they of ſuch weight here, as next to the demonſtration of the Spirit of God,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61707:11"/> they are the greateſt means to bring up mens aſſent to a full and quieting reſt on that ſecurity to which they muſt truſt themſelves for ever, and to let them ſee, that this even here by the way, is aſſuredly full, though not yet their enjoyment. III. Becauſe this faith of aſſent, ſhould be firſt followed in the order of nature, as being the very firſt principle of converſion, to know and be ſure, that God hath ſent his ſon into the world to ſave ſinners; wherein as the Holy Ghoſt is not the Obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctive, but the Efficient Cauſe of our Faith, ſo is not the internal work and Teſtimony, he gives on the Soul the firſt Teſtimony, but muſt ſtill have reſpect to the revelation of the Word without, and ſuch demonſtrative evidences thereof, wherewith it is revealed to the world. Nor may any ever ſeparate, that which God hath himſelf ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolubly joyned. IV. That there is ſo convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a neceſſity and uſe hereof to the Church, and in a ſpecial way with reſpect to the youth, for a more firm laying of the groundwork of their Chriſtian profeſſion, and for the ſeed-plot of a bleſſed and deſirable growth amongſt ſuch in this day; that they might thus know early, ſomething of theſe primary grounds and demonſtrations of their faith; ſo alſo is it a ſtudy of that high importance, as I humbly judge ſhould be of notable uſe for a Manuduction in the firſt place to Students of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, before they launch forth in that vaſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Ocean of the ſpeculative part thereof; and for being at ſome greater advantage thus for carrying on ſuch a confirming work in the Church in their future ſervice. V. Yea of what uſe might this be with reſpect to many, who may be ſore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61707:11"/> haunted, with hidden and dreadful temptations to infidelity, and to weaken them in the very foundations of their faith; who are wholly unfurniſhed of any ſuch grounds and arguments in their judgment to repel the ſame: and it is certain that to believe firmly the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, that God was manifeſted in our nature, to ſave man, is with reſpect to the object a much higher act of faith, than to believe, that he will ſave us; ſince as the one doth unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably more tranſcend all human reaſon than the other, ſo doth the Apoſtle thus argue from the greater to the leſs, Rom. 8.32. that he who gave his own ſon to the death; will he not alſo with him give us all things?</p>
               <p>Poſit. III. <hi>That ſuch a Confirming Work, was moſt ſpecially followed in the Practice of the Primitive Times, and one of the great Ends of the Miniſtry of the</hi> Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, <hi>to have this Faith of Aſſent and Doctrinal Certainty thereof, on its proper Grounds and Evidences, deeply founded in Mens Judgment; is ſo clear as cannot come under Debate.</hi> I. That this way did the great Author of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion himſelf take, not only by the Authority of his Word, and the Power and Energy of Grace, but with that Convincing Evidence and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his Truth to Mens Underſtanding, as might found alſo a firm and rational Aſſurance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. II. That for this End, he did pray the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21. and was ſo much preſſed herein, that ſo great an external Demonſtration of the Truth of the Goſpel, in the Concord and Unity of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, might be kept clear, that the World might thus believe that he was ſent of God, and have a deeper Conviction hereof wrought in them, by ſuch an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61707:12"/> III. That one ſpecial Intent of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of <hi>Luke,</hi> was for this end, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.4. That men might know not only the things themſelves by a naked Relation, but the Certainty of theſe things, wherein they had been formerly Inſtructed. IV. That herein did the Miniſtry of <hi>Apollos</hi> ſo brightly ſhine forth, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.28. And was then of moſt ſingular uſe to the Church, by that clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of rational Conviction and demonſtrative Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for the Truth of Chriſt, as the greateſt gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers could not withſtand. V. That it's ſure it was then without Exception expreſly required of the meaneſt within the Church, to be always ready to render the Reaſons of their Hope to all who asked: and not only to know what they did Believe, but why they did ſo, as is clear, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. This could not be by bringing forth of internal Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, for Conviction of others, but by giving them an account of the moſt cogent grounds and demonſtrations of the Goſpel, as might be moſt prevalent, and confirming to the weak, and leave others inexcuſable; and ſeems to have been then ſpecially preſſed in theſe Primitive Times, as a proper Teſt of their Chriſtian Profeſſion. VI. And we ſee herein alſo, how much theſe excellent <hi>Bereans</hi> were taken up, and were ſo highly commended of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, Act.</hi> 17.11. To know the <hi>demonſtrative</hi> part of Chriſtianity, and by its own evidence, with that intire harmony and conſent of the Scripture therein, and their being thus diligently intent in that comparing-work of Religion, to ſee the truth thereof not ſingly and apart by themſelves alone, but in that joynt-union &amp; coherence wherein they ſtand, each in their own room, for confirming
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61707:12"/> and giving light to other. VII. That this was the way alſo, wherein the Goſpel did come to the Gentile Church is clearly ſhewed 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Not in Word only, but as in Power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, ſo alſo in much Aſſurance of Underſtanding, upon its own Evidence,</hi> which was that way, it did ſo wonderfully prevail over the world againſt nature, and the ſtream of fleſh and blood, that ſtood in the furtheſt oppoſition thereto. VIII. That one of the greateſt ſervices of the Apoſtles in their viſiting the Churches, did expreſly lie here, Acts 14.22. To confirm the ſouls of the Diſciples in the firſt place in the certainty of their faith, and then in exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to continue in the ſame, ſo as they might follow the Lord, with the furtheſt light and aſſurance of Mind, amidſt the great Tryals of ſuch a time. IX. That it's this way alſo the World is rendred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable for their misbelief of the Goſpel, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch ſufficiency of means given for this end, by ſo great a diſcovery of the confirming evidences of its rruth, ſo as they can have no pretence herein, but an obſtinacy and reſolution not to be convinced; on which ground doth our Bleſſed Lord teſtify, that it was no want of light, upon the certainty of his truth, why men did not receive it, but that they loved darkneſs better than light, becauſe their deeds were evil; and when ſuch clear, rational, and convincing evidences are laid open to their view, how moſt men poſſibly can get theſe put by or rejected, is not eaſy to comprehend, but that a real Irritation and torment of Spirit, from ſuch clearneſs of evidence, doth thus more tend to harden than convince.</p>
               <p>Poſit. IV. <hi>That there is a continued neceſſity of ſuch</hi> a Confirmation in the Faith <hi>to this day, what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61707:13"/> ever can be objected of ſo long a conſent and preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time in the profeſſion thereof, is fully demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable on theſe grounds.</hi> I. Becauſe it is ſure, the Chriſtian faith doth ſtill need theſe aſſiſtances and it is a ſtrange miſtake, that only for <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> ſuch confirming evidences of the ſame ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but not for any under a viſible profeſſion, when the whole of <hi>Divinity,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>our Faith,</hi> is ſo full of demonſtrative arguments, for the daily uſe of the moſt eſtabliſhed Chriſtians in their paſſage through time. II. That as the higheſt motives to all ſerious godlineſs and the moral duties of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity muſt needs be from its known certainty to us, ſo is the continued uſe thereof to be ſtill the ſame. III. That theſe numerous tryals and conflicts of Chriſtians now, do no leſs call for ſome higher eſtabliſhment in the truth on which they muſt alone reſt when all viſible props fail in their judgments, than of ſupporting grace; nor is it conceivable how men can this day walk in the light of any true joy and comfort, without a more ſolid aſſurance of their being on ſafe grounds herein than moſt ſeem to reckon. IV. Becauſe the revelation of the Goſpel, and of an eternal ſtate in another world, is ſo great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, as it's ſtrange how this is not the higheſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of mens life, to have their faith more deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed on the furtheſt tryal of their ſecurity now by the way herein, who muſt ſhortly make ſo great a tryal thereof at death; for if we were but once come thus far as to ask our own Soul what the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> indeed is, that we are thus called to believe, it could not poſſibly but beget ſome extaſie of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at the greatneſs thereof, and to reckon any light and implicit aſſent to the ſame as a degree
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61707:13"/> both of Atheiſm and Indifferency in this matter. V. Though there be no conflict with Heathens, as in the firſt times, yet was ſuch a ſpirit never at a higher pitch than it is now to take off all firm aſſent to the greateſt principles of truth, when Atheiſm ſeems to be at its laſt attempt in the world, and we are fallen in ſo amazing an hour of the power of darkneſs as makes theſe latter times more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perillous and trying than the firſt. VI. Yea if ſuch a confirming work, be one of the greateſt means to advance the repute and honour of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when its wonted awe and veneration is ſo far loſt, and to awake men to deeper impreſſions of its truth, when ſo few ſeem now under any ſuch weight; then it is certain there was never more need of the ſame than in this day.</p>
               <p>Poſit. V. <hi>That ſuch a Service to the</hi> Church, <hi>doth not only reſpect the more knowing, inquiſitive, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious part thereof, but the meaneſt Profeſſours of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion alſo, of whom this is neceſſarily required, is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident on theſe grounds.</hi> I. Becauſe each Chriſtian ſhould have undoubtedly ſuch a <hi>ballaſt</hi> on their own Soul, of the ſolid and rational Grounds of their Faith, as well as thoſe of greater parts and Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the promoting of which were it more deeply conſidered, I dare humbly adventure to ſay would be found one of the choiceſt means to promote Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity this day. II. Becauſe this is not to drive any to doubt or queſtion the leaſt ſincere degree of <hi>aſſent,</hi> though it be not with ſuch ſtrength of evidence as in others, nor can by that formal argumentation give the ſame account thereof; ſince a few grounds this way may ſpecially help to ſome ſolid conviction &amp; confirming of their mind, when they may be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61707:14"/> of many other cogent arguments for this end; but 'tis certain alſo the greater clearneſs of evidence doth ſtill in the appointed way of means lead in to a more firm and ſtrong aſſent of the judgment, to the truth of our Religion. III. Becauſe the ſtrength of the foundation in it ſelf cannot be enough if it be not with ſuch a known evidence, as men may build firmly and with aſſurance thereon: Nor hath the Lord thus only deſigned to give his people an infallible and ſure teſtimony to adventure on, but that it ſhould be made ſure alſo to them. IV. Becauſe none can in truth ſay that <hi>Jeſus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 22.3. by which is not to be underſtood ſo much the neceſſity of ſupernatural grace, for a ſaving faith, but that none can give a true aſſent and confeſſion of the ſame, but from theſe grounds and arguments which are revealed by the Holy Ghoſt unto men for this end; and as it's certain that theſe <hi>Characters &amp; evidence of Divinity,</hi> which are imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the whole revelation of the Goſpel, may be clear and demonſtrative to our judgment, ſo are they as truly <hi>divine,</hi> as the doctrine which is confirmed thereby. V. Becauſe there can be no poſſible cauſe for Unbelief of the truth from any intricate obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſame, when the Lord hath given ſuch great aſſiſtances to our faith to be <hi>as milk for babes</hi> as well as <hi>meat to ſtrong men.</hi> And though it be objected that the furtheſt objective evidence of the Goſpel, with ſo clear and ſtrong a conveyance thereof, is yet ſo little operative on moſt; the ſame might be ſaid alſo of the whole letter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but tho this tends not in the leaſt to reſolve our Religion into any meer exerciſe of reaſon, and leaves the whole work of the Spirit, in its energy and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61707:14"/> operation therewith on mens ſouls, intire; yet doth it fully evince ſuch a ſufficiency of evidence with the Chriſtian faith, as makes any doubtfulneſs herein ſimply impoſſible, through want of the greateſt advantage of means; yea ſuch as are of another kind than to induce only <hi>a probable perſwaſion</hi> of the ſame. VI. Becauſe it is one of the ſaddeſt Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the preſent State of Religion, that ſo few almoſt in whole Congregations can give any clear Aſſent to the Truth and Certainty thereof, but to Amazement both live and die Strangers to the ſame, yea how many of theſe who are otherwiſe Serious in Religion, yet have their <hi>Faith starved</hi> this way, and are deſtitute of any ſuch ſupport; but as it is not the <hi>numerouſneſs of Profeſſours,</hi> but the <hi>Strength and ſolidity of their Faith,</hi> wherein the Churches Strength moſt lies, and hath more flouriſhed in a few ſuch to beget a greater Awe and Veneration of Religion amongſt Men, than at other times in the greateſt Multitude; ſo is it the Glory of Divine Truth, that it can ſubſiſt by its own proper Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and preſerve its Station in the worſt of times, when all External Arguments do moſt viſibly ceaſe.</p>
               <p>Poſit. VI. <hi>That it's fully demonſtrable and clear, how no ſimple inſtructing of men in the</hi> general Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion, <hi>can be the proper and adequate means for ſuch a Faith of Aſſent to the Truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, on its own Evidence, or anſwer that</hi> Apoſtolick Pattern of laying the Foundation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. <hi>But that ſome ſpecial Duties elſe are called for to ſo high an end; ſuch wherein not only that true Primitive Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Chriſtian Faith might have ſome Practical uſe, but we might alſo Hope therewith, for a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable out-letting of Confirming Influences of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61707:15"/> Spirit of God.</hi> What is to be underſtood herein I ſhall humbly offer in a few <hi>particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. That it is one of the greateſt concerns of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Work,</hi> and of the <hi>Key of Doctrine,</hi> to have all who hear the Goſpel, in the <hi>firſt</hi> place preſſed to take Religion ſo far to Heart, as to make a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inquiry into the Grounds and Reaſons hereof, and thus to know their being on ſure ground here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, not becauſe they know not another way, but becauſe they know this is the alone way of Truth, to which they dare truſt their Immortal Souls. II. That for this End the Supream Truths of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be repreſented with that certainty of <hi>Evidence, and Demonſtration,</hi> as both ſuch great and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things do require, and the temper of ſuch a gain-ſaying Age now calls for; and to have this preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more on mens Judgment and Conſcience, that the <hi>things of God,</hi> which are of the <hi>higheſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, Reality and Subſtance,</hi> can have no poſſible Reception by any implicite or probable belief there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, nor can admit any pretence for the ſame, when the Lord hath given ſuch kind of Proofs and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as leaves mens darkneſs herein without any ſhaddow of excuſe.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That it peculiarly belongs to the <hi>Catechetical Work of Religion,</hi> to take ſome account of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Profeſſours thereof, and with a ſpecial reſpect to the <hi>Youth;</hi> of their <hi>Faith of Aſſent</hi> to the Doctrine of Chriſt, on what <hi>grounds</hi> and certainty of evidence this is founded, and for their inſtructing therein, as well as in the <hi>general Principles</hi> of Religion; when one of the moſt ruining things to the Church lies here, that the Profeſſion of moſt is laid in ſo deep an Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, as they have almoſt nothing to ſay for the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61707:15"/> ſame, but a naked Affirmation. I know the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty hereof for the weak may be objected, but without juſt cauſe; ſince as the Prime Truths of Religion are few, eaſie and plain for the meaneſt Capacity, ſo alſo are the <hi>Primary Evidences and Demonſtrations of our Faith,</hi> if ſuch once with that deſire did ſearch after the ſame, as for a hidden and invaluable Treaſure; wherein this reſpect ſhould be ſtill had, to difference betwixt what is Initial and of a more fundamental concern for the weak, and what may tend to an higher growth and increaſe of others.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It ſhould be of greateſt uſe and advantage al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the ſame end, that the <hi>young growth</hi> now co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up in the Church, were put to give ſome <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Evidence</hi> of their Conſent and Choice of the Profeſſion of Chriſt, ſo far as may witneſs a Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant,</hi> now as their own proper Deed, wherein they were implicitely inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in their Infancy. Some ſpecial Grounds and Reaſons for this, are; I. Becauſe God will have his Service freely entred in and upon <hi>choice,</hi> as that way which is moſt agreeable to his Honour; for as the <hi>Covenant</hi> binds mutually, ſo do the <hi>Seals</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alſo, and therefore upon our part is <hi>Baptiſm a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Oath of Allegiance to God.</hi> II. Becauſe it tends to a more reſolute and firm adherence to the Service of God, that this buſineſs ſhould be perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally brought home to Mens Conſcience, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their firſt admittance to the Sacrament of the Lord's ſupper, and thus to ingage them as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24.22. <hi>Ye are witneſſes againſt your ſelves herein, and they ſaid, We are witneſſes.</hi> III. Becauſe this is expreſly held forth 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. where <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61707:16"/> is called the anſwer of a good conſcience toward God,</hi> upon this ground, that ſuch then who were come to years of knowledge, were perſonally brought to confirm by their own conſent that ſolemn Ingagement and Dedication by Baptiſm to be the Lords, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is <hi>vox juris,</hi> and ſignifies, <hi>ſponſio, &amp; ſtipulatio publica inter Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, &amp; Dominum Chriſtum,</hi> as the moſt Judicious Commentators on that Scripture do clearly render it; and ſo this was a ſpecial part of the Primitive Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, not only with reſpect to ſuch, who were Converted from <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> but were born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church, and Partakers of that <hi>Seal of Baptiſm in their Infancy,</hi> to bring them to anſwer to that great Demand of the Covenant, Do you now Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent upon <hi>Evidence and Choice,</hi> to be the Lords, and to be a Subject of his Kingdom, and embrace the Laws thereof, and do you thus in Sincerity and Truth declare the ſame wherein you have a good Conſcience before God? And of what bleſſed Fruit and Advantage ſhould this be both for the Increaſe and Honour of the Goſpel, if this were more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken to Heart for ſome Practical uſe, according to the <hi>Rule,</hi> and <hi>Primitive Pattern</hi> in the Churches of Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It were ſpecially deſirable alſo, that there be ſome <hi>clear view and ſummary</hi> by it ſelf, of the moſt <hi>cogent Grounds and Demonſtrations of the Chriſtian Faith,</hi> with reſpect both to the <hi>Doctrinal, Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and Prophetical</hi> part thereof, and in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner accommodated, as the meaneſt within the Church might have ſuch a help ſtill at their hand, and thus with the leaſt expence of time, be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of ſuch Arguments and Reaſons, as ſhould tend
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61707:16"/> (through the Bleſſing of God) not only to the furtheſt rational Aſſent, and Certainty of the Truth of their Profeſſion, but to give a moſt ſpecial ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Mind againſt that inward Tryal of Satans Temptations and Fiery Darts this way; yea is ſuch a mean, that in the ſerious Improvement hereof by having ſuch Evidences once brought in on Mens Judgment and Conſcience, ſo as to ſee with their own Eyes the Truth of the ſame, I muſt humbly judge, there is nothing, next to the internal work of the Spirit, of this kind, might tend more to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Kingdom of Chriſt in this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poſit.</hi> VII. <hi>That as there are ſome more</hi> ſignal Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of time, <hi>to which a greater brightneſs and increaſe of Light hath reſpect under the</hi> New Teſtament; <hi>ſo doth there now ſeem to be ſome remarkable Call and Excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſuch a</hi> Confirming Work, <hi>in this day about the Chriſtian Faith; when we may hope that a more</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemn and reſtoring time of Religion <hi>in the World, is on a near approach, (though all ſenſible evidence would ſeem to controul this) and may be now more looked after, and prepared for, under a ſuitable Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe</hi> Grounds <hi>for the ſame.</hi> I. That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed time of the <hi>Converſion of the Jews</hi> doth aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly draw near; and whatever be judged by ſome of the Lords immediate Appearance herein by a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,</hi> yet is it unqueſtionable that nothing in the way of means could be more promiſing and hopeful to promote this great end, than by promoting ſo great a Service as this for the Chriſtian Church. II. That a greater extent alſo of the Profeſſion of Chriſt amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and rending of the Vail that is now over many dark Nations, ſeemeth clearly inſured therewith; and what a hopeful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61707:17"/> ſhould this be if ſuch a <hi>Publick and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Spirit</hi> were more ſeen, how to advance the higheſt Ends of Religion on ſuch an account with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to any partial or divided Intereſt? Yea that this bleſt Zeal of God might in that manner appear to have the dark World get a more clear and convincing proſpect of the <hi>higheſt rational Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Chriſtianity,</hi> as might through the Lords Gracious Concurrence bring men once to an <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive and Serious Spirit</hi> about the ſame. Oh that ſuch may be raiſed up in this diſmal hour with ſomething of that ancient Spirit, to travel with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for the <hi>Salvation of Mankind,</hi> and of whom it may be ſaid, as of bleſt <hi>Nehemiah, theſe are indeed come to ſeek the welfare of their People,</hi> in their greateſt Intereſt. III. And this farther excitement we are now under for this end, in a time when Popery ſeems to be upon one of its laſt and greateſt Aſſaults againſt the Church; ſince it's ſo clear that what ever tends to Confirm Men in Chriſtianity from their own Tryal and Inquiry upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming Evidences thereof, muſt have the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive reſult, to make ſuch Confirmed Proteſtants; yea nothing is more demonſtrable than that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Grounds that are taken both to ingage and fix men in the Popiſh Profeſſion, have the ſame ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Tendency to promote Atheiſm, and to give Infidels the greateſt Advantage to reject the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt. <hi>He that hath Ears to hear, let him hear,</hi> Amen.</p>

That it can be no more ſure, that this marvellous frame of the Heavens and Earth hath a being, and is the Object of our Senſe, than that a Supream Infinite Wiſdom and Power muſt be the firſt cauſe hereof, and it were ſimply impoſſible it could ever otherwiſe have been. II. That he hath thus made himſelf <hi>Viſible</hi> to our Eyes, by ſuch a <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible World,</hi> and in ſo exquiſite an Order and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence to ſupport the ſame, as nothing ſtands alone by it ſelf, but in a line of mutual reſpect, which runs through the whole Creation. We may as clearly thus ſee, that God is, as that there is an inviſible Soul in a living Body. III. That this Harmony is amongſt things, in their own Nature
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61707:18"/> ſo Contrary and Deſtructive to other, for to hold this wonderful frame, as all muſt abandon Reaſon, or ſee an infinitely wiſe Conduct herein; and no need of Extraordinary <hi>Miracles,</hi> to Confirm what the whole Conſtitutions of Nature do Witneſs. IV. That this rare frame of man could never have come in being, but by him who could Unite ſuch different Subſtances as a <hi>Material Body,</hi> and an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Soul,</hi> in ſo near and marvellous an Union. V. That there is ſuch an univerſal Conſent of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in all Ages thereto, as ſhews Religion to be founded in the very Nature of Man, and as Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to his Being, as his Reaſon is, yea that the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate difference of Man from the Beaſt, and moſt eſſential Property of humane Nature lies here.

VII. That the Reaſon of the whole Conſtitution of Nature, and viciſsitude of things here, is ſo great, as, without ſhutting out the uſe of Reaſon, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee, how nothing poſsibly could have been better; and that any want hereof in the whole frame of the Univerſe, would be as the Diſlocation of a joynt of the Body, and were not conceivable to be otherwiſe than it is by Infinite Wiſdom appointed. VIII. That it's ſimply impoſsible that God Bleſſed for ever ſhould not exiſt, or that this Univerſe, (which is a work ſo highly becoming the greatneſs of its Maker) could poſsibly ſubſiſt for one hour or

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I.

II.

III. If there be a gradual Increaſe of human Learning on the Earth, and a further diſcovery of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61707:19"/> Arts and Sciences; and the greateſt Experiments and Inventions have been but of a late Riſe and Date; then can there not poſſibly be an Eternal Succeſſion of Mankind, with a continued Progreſs and Experience this way; nor can it be that but of late one part of the World is known and diſcovered to another. IV. That ſo ſhort an Hiſtory as we have in the moſt Ancient Records of time, were wholly Inconſiſtent with ſuch an Eternal Duration, or that Infinite Ages preceding ſhould leave no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance to Poſterity, when ſo ſmall a meaſure of time, as a few <hi>thouſand years,</hi> have left ſo much. V. Nor could men beget men Eternally without going back to ſome firſt man, who could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get himſelf. VI. That if Eternity be preferable to time, then ſhould not the excellenteſt being in the Earth, <hi>Man,</hi> be thus corruptible, and only this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate Maſs of the Earth Eternal.

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I. That it is clear the ſupport of this great frame of the Univerſe, with that continued and regular courſe of nature herein, is as ſimply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible without an infinite Divine Power, as its firſt Being and Creation. II. That ſuch an extent of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61707:19"/> Providence as reſpects ſo innumerable Objects, with ſuch a Contrariety both of Qualities and Paſſions in the ſame, muſt needs be from an Infinite and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Cauſe. III. That all things to this day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in that eſtabliſhed Order of ſecond Cauſes, wherein God hath placed them by a Law ſo Viſibly Imprinted on the Nature of things without Reaſon, that they do as exactly anſwer the ſame in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Courſe and Station, as if they had a rational Knowledg of their Duty. IV. That Univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the <hi>Sun in the Firmament</hi> hath to things here below, though at ſo great a diſtance, which doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceaſe, or grow weary to ſend forth its beams and hidden influences to the meaneſt Creatures, may let us clearly ſee, how it hath the ſame Viſible Uſe and End to Confirm an Incomprehenſible and Infinite Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence about the meaneſt things, as well as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. V. That immediate Precedency of the Soul in that leſſer World of Man, bears the ſame Evidence therewith; which though we never ſaw with our eyes, yet doth undeniably actuate the whole body in its Functions, as the proper Spring of every act and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there.

By theſe extraordinary and wonderful Works of Providence, which have been in all Ages. IX.

By ſuch a <hi>Natural Obligation</hi> to Moral Duties, with the Sence of a difference betwixt good and evil, as is founded in the very rational Nature of Man, that none can poſſibly root out, even where the Scripture is not known. XI. By that Natural Confidence alſo in God, which all Men have, and recourſe to him on any preſent extream hazard, to Witneſs not only that the moſt High bears Rule in the Kingdoms of men, but that the Sence and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hereof is unavoidable.</p>

That natural ſenſe of good and evil, and eſſential difference betwixt the ſame, which is ſo firmly founded in the Reaſon of all Mankind, as no human Laws or Cuſtom could ever take this off their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or make an indifference herein, without extinguiſhing the very Nature of Man; to ſhew that Eternal and Unchangeable difference, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61707:20"/> the Holy Nature of God hath put betwixt them. II. That we ſee the worſt of Men ſo conſtrain'd to an awful Senſe and Regard of <hi>Truth and weldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and to acknowledge the Lovelineſs and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency hereof, as does make them ſeek their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute by a falſe ſhew and counterfeit of the ſame; and gives ſuch a Being and Riſe to that dreadful Impoſture of <hi>Hypocriſie.</hi> III. That it's the <hi>Truths</hi> Priviledge ever to outlive <hi>Falſhood,</hi> and prevail o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſame, yea to have the greater Triumph af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its ſoreſt Conflicts; and how this is of as funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental a Conſtitution in the courſe of Providence, as the moſt firm Eſtabliſhment of Nature. IV. That in no time ſince man was formed in the Earth, doth true <hi>Joy and Serenity of Mind,</hi> ceaſe to be the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive reſult of <hi>welldoing,</hi> or the <hi>Fruit of Righteouſneſs to be Peace and Aſſurance of Mind,</hi> nor hath it ever wanted a Witneſs, even before any Word given of the Lords taking Pleaſure herein. V. That it's ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, in the moſt diſmal times, what a publick <hi>Bleſſing</hi> ſuch are, who by more extraordinary Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als have been put to the higheſt Exerciſe of their Grace and Patience; yea how Viſibly ſuch have been promoted to the moſt honourable Service for God, and to advance the Credit of Religion before Men, who on the firſt ſight and view have been accounted the moſt miſerable of any. VI. Whilſt, <hi>on the other hand,</hi> it may be ever ſeen, how with the greateſt <hi>Proſperity</hi> of the wicked here, there are <hi>Puniſhments of another kind</hi> Diſpenſed, and more dreadful than any outward Affliction, ſuch as <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Obſtinacy, and Blindneſs of Mind in Oppoſition to God,</hi> even when their own ruine is made Viſible to them herein. VII. How oft men are thus evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61707:21"/> condemned to be happy in this World by ſome ſtrange meaſure of <hi>Temporal Succeſs and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity,</hi> before ſome great Fall and Ruine, as the Iſſue hereof in the laſt ſcene of Providence, doth ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly atteſt. VIII. That it's ſeen alſo, how Sin doth ever bring its own <hi>Puniſhment</hi> with it, in ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun Degree both of Shame and Torment; and, as <hi>Seneca,</hi> an Heathen, could ſay, <hi>That Wickedneſs was the moſt exquiſite Contriver of human Miſery,</hi> ſo the World likewiſe may ſee how a preſent immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from Judgment is no releaſe, but when its Sentence is not <hi>ſpeedily Executed,</hi> yet is it at laſt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed. IX. And how evident is it, that the greateſt haters of Godlineſs are yet inforced to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame and the Chriſtians choice herein, as the greateſt Wiſdom, upon any ſurprizing State and Extremity; yea how ſuch would be glad to joyn Intereſts then with ſuch in their Death, whom they moſt contemned in their Life.</p>
                  <p>Qu. V. <hi>How is it Convincing and Demonſtrable, that God hath given any clear and expreſs Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Will and Counſel unto Men, and that ſuch a</hi> wonderful Record <hi>is undoubtedly extant in the World.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> That, I.

II. That this alſo muſt be known and diſplay its Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Efficacy to the World, in that manner, and by ſuch infallible Evidence of its Truth, as may render all inexcuſable, who give not intire Credit thereto. III. I can be no more clear and aſſured that there
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61707:21"/> is but one <hi>Sun in the Firmament,</hi> than that there is but one <hi>Fountain,</hi> and <hi>Repoſitory of Sacred Light</hi> about Religion, which is the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and its being the alone publick Standard of truth to the whole World. IV. That no way was ever made known to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mankind from a ſtate of Bondage, Darkneſs, and Miſery, conſiſtent with the very uſe of reaſon, but by this bleſſed light which ſhineth there. V. Yea that there is as viſible a difference, betwixt the ſame and any pretended Religion which ever was beſides in the World, as there is <hi>betwixt day and night,</hi> which is founded in the immutable nature of theſe things in themſelves. VI. That there is one proper <hi>Sphere,</hi> where this glorious Light of Divine Truth is fixed, and wherein it ſhines forth from one Age to another; which is the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                  <p>Qu. VI. <hi>But what more peculiar evidences can you ſhew of the</hi> Divinity of the Scriptures, <hi>that all may ſee them to be of infallible truth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I. That it's ſure ſuch a <hi>book</hi> is this day in the Earth, which no created wiſdom could ever have made, and contains ſuch things of higheſt concern to mankind, as does infinitely exceed the bounds of human ability and invention, and could never have been diſcovered but by God himſelf. II. That it gives forth ſuch exquiſite <hi>laws</hi> and conſtitutions of our religion, as men muſt needs ſee the <hi>holy nature, purity, and perfection of God,</hi> moſt brightly ſhining forth therein. III. Which doth diſcover ſo great and proper a relief for all thoſe evils and miſeries that do attend this fallen eſtate of man, as none but an all-ſufficient God could work. IV. That he alone muſt be the author of this bleſſed record, who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61707:22"/> rules the World, and hath determined the changes and revolutions thereof, when it is not more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that theſe viſible Heavens are ſtretched forth over the Earth, than that this <hi>Line of the Scripture is</hi> ſtretched over the whole Work and <hi>Frame of Providence,</hi> and doth moſt clearly and brightly <hi>illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate</hi> the ſame. V. That ſurely this was the product of Infinite Wiſdom, that ſo great a variety of matter ſhould meet with ſo viſible a concent and harmony in one perfect and intire frame; yea knit in ſo cloſe a bond of union together, as makes the whole Bible to be intirely <hi>one piece;</hi> though in the writing of each diſtinct part thereof it could never have poſſibly been contrived or foreſeen by human wiſdom, as we ſee here, of ſo admirable an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and correſpondence, as is in all the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. VI. That none elſe could have ſpoke to the World, in ſo Majeſtick a way, and ſo becoming the greatneſs and ſoveraignty of God, to aſſume ſuch a ſupremacy, and give forth Laws for abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute obedience from all Mankind thereto, and on ſuch a penalty of eternal deſtruction; or that any impoſtors, either poſſibly could, or durſt have, in ſuch a manner, perſonated the ſame. VII. That it muſt needs be his word who perfectly knows what is in man, and hath an abſolute authority over the Soul, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts thereof, who thus not only gives law to the Conſcience, and our inward parts, but doth eſtabliſh an internal Religion there, no leſs abſolutely, than what reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects our external work and actions. VIII. Yea where all may ſee the Penmen thereof under ſo intire a ſubjection to the doctrine which they taught, and that it is no contrivance of their own,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61707:22"/> as they did record their own failings, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, in behalf of the truth; and did thus alſo require all juſt reſpect and obedience to Magiſtrates, when through the whole Earth they were then greateſt Enemies to the Truth of the Goſpel. IX. That this muſt be his Word, who alone can derive principles of life to his own inſtitutions, and animate the ſame with a quickening Spirit; and is a work above the contrivance of Angels or Men, when directed to each new trial of the Church, and perſonal caſe of Chriſtians, as though it had been alone written for that time; ſo that I can be no more perſuaded in reaſon that there is ſuch a Book as the <hi>Bible</hi> in the Earth, than that it came from Heaven, and is the alone rule of Religion, and of Divine Revelation, for the governing of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>Qu. VII. <hi>How is the ſecure</hi> conveyance of the Scripture <hi>demonſtrable amidſt all the changes of times paſt, and that there could be no poſſible tendency to its corruption?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. That it's ſo undeniably the firſt rule which ever was given to mankind about Religion, and the alone <hi>publick ſtandard of Truth,</hi> that hath endured the trial and inquiry of all times paſt, ſo as no pretences in the matter of Antiquity could yet ever be to the <hi>contrary.</hi> II. That there is ſo exact an <hi>Harmony</hi> betwixt <hi>the Old and New Teſtament,</hi> as the one is a viſible tranſcript of the other, in its accompliſhment; that I can be no more ſure of ſuch a venerable record as the Old Teſtament, and its unalterable conveyance to the Church, to which the whole race of the Jews is yet a ſtanding witneſs, than how it is continued and perfected in the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61707:23"/> of the Goſpel, and but one intire frame. III. That its deliverance was by no private deed, but by a publick truſt to the whole Univerſal Church; ſo as it were more eaſie in the way of reaſon to queſtion the moſt fundamental ſtatutes and laws of any Nation, by which mens private right and property is ſecured, than the truth hereof. IV. That under the Goſpel it hath been ſo fully diſperſed over the World, and in ſuch various lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; that an innumerable company of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians theſe 1600 years paſt, have been as common living Books of the ſame. V. That thoſe nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Verſions and Commentaries written thereon in diverſe Languages, do fully evidence they had the ſame Scripture, and no other than what we have this day. VI. That this was delivered to the Church not only in writing, but in that form of ſound words, for keeping cloſe thereto, as could admit of no poſſible tendency to corrupt or alter the ſame; beſides the continued and publick refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that hath been ſince the firſt Ages of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to its deciſion, which all theſe ſharp controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, that have been in the Church on all ſides, do inevitably require.</p>

That this was not done in a corner, but in the publick view of men in thoſe days, moſt known to all and famous; yea by the ſpecial appointment of God at ſo ſolemn a time of the <hi>Paſſover in Jeruſalem,</hi> where <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover was then Sacrificed.</hi> VI.

VII. That herein have all divided parties <hi>and ſects</hi> in the Chriſtian World been enforced ſtill to meet and conſent, in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the ſubſtance thereof. VIII. That in the ſame light which was held forth in the Old Teſtament about the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> did the whole <hi>Gentile Church</hi> enter; and made claim to their right for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adopted the Seed and Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> on theſe clear and expreſs Promiſes given for the ſame; which the Jews could not but confeſs to be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority.</p>

That there might be a more diſtinct repreſenting of the <hi>glory of this Myſtery</hi> to Angels and Men, in ſuch <hi>a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual</hi> opening up of the ſame. II. To put that weight and high value on his own <hi>Promiſe and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony</hi> herein, when on the alone credit thereof, he would thus both try, and bear out the <hi>Faith of his Church,</hi> for ſo many <hi>Ages,</hi> and draw forth their deſires and longings in all that long ſpace of time after the ſame. III. To teſtifie the greatneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

To prepare the <hi>Church</hi> for ſo <hi>great a reception,</hi> by all that long <hi>preparatory ſervice of legal inſtitutions,</hi> it highly becoming the greatneſs of this <hi>myſtery,</hi> to have ſo ſolemn and wondrous an introduction thereto. V. That thus the World might have its full trial of the inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of natural abilities, and of any improvements of humane Wiſdom and Learning, for help; after this had firſt been at the furtheſt height both in <hi>Greece and Rome,</hi> before the alone <hi>Redeemer</hi> of the Church came.</p>
                  <p>Qu. IV. <hi>What can offer furtheſt conviction to the World, of the Truth of Chriſtianity from its nature and internal excellencies; and that it is no leſs eſſentially good in its ſelf, than evidently true?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. It is undeniable even to thoſe that live at a diſtance, that ſuch is the <hi>truth of Chriſt,</hi> that though all viſible and humane props ſhould fail, it can ſubſiſt by its <hi>own evidence, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> over Mens Conſciences; and hath thus ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved its ſtation in the worſt of times. II. That as it holds forth the moſt exquiſite <hi>rule of perfection</hi> to follow, ſo doth it bring the greateſt relief to the diſtempers of the mind, and thoſe miſeries which attend the humane ſtate here; ſo that a higher glory doth thus reſult to the <hi>Holy God,</hi> by this <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Grace</hi> to fallen Man than if he had ſtood in his <hi>Primitive ſtate.</hi> III. That it is ſure the Truth and Doctrine of Chriſt doth natively tend to fix men in a <hi>ſtate of light and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God,</hi> and in a <hi>State of Separation</hi> in their <hi>Principles, Affection,</hi> and <hi>Converſation</hi> from the World. IV. That it doth more brightly ſhine forth in <hi>ſimplicity, and truth and in its inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61707:26"/> and vital acts,</hi> than in any outward form or ſhow: Yea in the way of <hi>ſelf-denial, meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>poverty of ſpirit,</hi> doth ſuch an excellency appear, as in <hi>its own nature,</hi> hath as viſible a difference from the proud and vindictive ſpirit of this World, as the <hi>day</hi> hath from the <hi>night.</hi> V. That ſuch <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> can be known, by no naked <hi>doctrinal</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the ſame to mens judgment, or ſuch rules as any humane ſcience is acquired by, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an inward power, and principles of a <hi>new life;</hi> nor can there ever be a right knowledge of <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> until it be firſt ingrafted in a <hi>Divine Heart.</hi> So far is this <hi>myſtery</hi> above all humane rule, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance. VI. That it is ſtated in the greateſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to any falſe ſhow or <hi>hypocriſy;</hi> yea, brings ſuch inforcements therewith of candor, and truth, and of <hi>love, tenderneſs and ſympathy</hi> towards others, as all muſt ſee is not only the higheſt ornament and perfection of our nature, but the greateſt <hi>bleſſing to the World</hi> that ever was known. VII. That ſuch a native <hi>luſtre and fragrancy</hi> doth attend the truth, and ſimplicity of the Goſpel, as makes it no more poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for humane <hi>art</hi> or cunning to repreſent this, than to make the dead image of a <hi>man</hi> to live, or to paint on a board the <hi>vital ſcent</hi> of a Violet or Roſe, to our <hi>Senſes.</hi> VIII. That in this way of the <hi>Goſpels</hi> ſubduing Men to the Obedience thereof, by the power of <hi>inward Grace,</hi> the <hi>Glory of Chriſt</hi> doth more eminently ſhine forth, than if he had appeared for this end with the greateſt outward ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and attendance of Angels to our Bodily Eyes. IX. That it is viſible that the whole World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that is without the revelation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is a place where horrour, falſehood, and impiety do manifeſtly reign.</p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61707:26"/>
                  <p>Qu. V. <hi>But how do you receive ſo wonderfull a truth, as that of the Goſpel is, when it's now ſo great a diſtance of time from its firſt promulgation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ. I.</hi> That we can be no more ſure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the moſt viſible and preſent objects of ſenſe, than, that this is the ſame Goſpel which is ſtill ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forth to the world, whereby an innumerable company of all nations, tongues and languages, have received the ſpirit, and been ſealed; yea, it hath made that change upon men, in turning them from ungodlineſs and idols to ſerve the living God, as hath been no leſs marvellous than the turning of ſo many wolves into lambs. II. That it is the ſame goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which not only through a ſeries of 1600 years hath been atteſted, but by ſuch innumerable <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> who counted not their life dear unto the death for ſealing thereof, and found it ſweet to be offered up in the Flames for <hi>Chriſt.</hi> III. Which in all Ages paſt hath ſtood out the greateſt oppoſition that ever the World made to any intereſt, while the <hi>weapons of its Warfare were Spiritual, and not Carnal;</hi> and with that ſucceſs that made the time of the <hi>Churches hotteſt Perſecution</hi> from Heathens the time alſo of its moſt remarkable ſpreading in the World. IV. That the ſame <hi>Goſpel</hi> is revealed this day, which hath had ſuch diſcernible <hi>triumphs</hi> and ſucceſs when no external aſſiſtance could be had for it; and there was no viſible power by which it gained the moſt ſavage and dark parts of the Earth to take on the <hi>Yoak of Chriſt,</hi> and prefer the objects of Faith to the moſt deſireable <hi>objects of Senſe.</hi> V. Yea, the Goſpel hath not only had ſuch <hi>vital influence</hi> on Mens Heart and practice, to change it into the ſame <hi>Image;</hi> but that herein the doctrine of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61707:27"/> 
                     <hi>Croſs of Chriſt</hi> in the greateſt <hi>ſimplicity</hi> hath ſtill been the moſt effectual way of its conqueſt, and the greateſt attractive on Mens Souls to receive the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Qu. VI. <hi>How is it demonſtrable that ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſufferings of times paſt for the truth of Chriſt, were both founded on the alone certainty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and carried out by a Divine Spirit above any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Nature?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That it is ſure, I. Here was no <hi>Comedy,</hi> Play, or Perſonated ſufferings which the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> then and in after times, did endure for <hi>Chriſt;</hi> or that theſe unexpreſſible torments and pains were any <hi>Dream,</hi> and <hi>Deluſion</hi> either to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or the World, and that their adverſaries did thus conflict and wreſtle with their own <hi>ſhadow</hi> in ſo continued and cruel an oppoſition. II. That the <hi>Joy and Exultation of Spirit</hi> theſe Witneſſes had amidſt their <hi>Torments,</hi> (who otherwiſe wanted no ſenſe or feeling of their Pains and Sufferings,) could have no riſe but what was ſupernatural. III. That this could be no poſſible diſſimulation or <hi>counterfeit</hi> when they were ſtepping into <hi>Eternity,</hi> nor the product of a diſtempered judgment; whilſt all might ſee what ſeriouſneſs of Spirit, <hi>Tenderneſs, and Bowels of Compaſſion</hi> to their Adverſaries they did then evidence. IV. That thoſe greateſt ſufferings were upon choice, and Chriſtians haſtned to endure them rather than to be ſafe at the rate of receding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting in any thing from the Truth. V. Yea no natural Reaſon can comprehend how ſuch mean and feeble perſons as many of theſe were, ſhould endure, what would have made the greateſt <hi>natural Courage</hi> to faint, as if they had foregone all Humane Paſſions
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61707:27"/> which Fleſh and Blood muſt needs have herein; ſo that I am conſtrain'd to ſee ſomething no leſs marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ſupernatural in the <hi>Faith of Martyrs,</hi> than in the <hi>Faith of Miracles.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ſimply impoſſible to make a rational trial herein, and not ſee the certainty of this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, to be thus clear. I. That there needs no more for any of a ſerious ſpirit, but to come and ſee, what the whole frame of <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> was, and if it be poſſible to deny, (even under any ſenſe of the law and dictates of Nature,) its being the higheſt reproach of Mankind; and that the very <hi>myſteries</hi> of that <hi>Heatheniſh worſhip,</hi> were ſo horrid and impure, as they needed a Vail from the common view of the World. II.

III. That

To perſwade men without any <hi>Motives,</hi> or Inducements from this preſent World, to imbrace a Doctrine ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant to Nature; yea to prefer an Intereſt of things <hi>not ſeen,</hi> and which none ever in the Earth ſaw, to the moſt deſirable <hi>Objects of Senſe.</hi> II. To admit no <hi>implicite Reception</hi> from any, but on their exacteſt Inquiry and Tryal herein; or in another way claim an Intereſt in Mens Affections, but by a full Aſſent of their Light and Judgment to the ſame. III. To admit no Gratification to the moſt Predominant Deſires and Inclinations of Men towards any Darling Sin; which according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Wiſdom would be judged of an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for gaining any Acceptance with ſuch; yea to give no partial reſpect to the greateſt <hi>Princes</hi> more than to the meaneſt. IV. To purſue its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, by ſo plain a Diſcovery of the <hi>Death, and Sufferings of our Bleſſed Lord, with the whole Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny thereof,</hi> when nothing could more evidently controul ſuch an end by any Rules of human Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Policy, if there had been conſulting with Fleſh and Blood herein.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The greatneſs of this Demonſtration may be thus evident to all. I. That it's ſo clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative of the <hi>Purity of our Religion,</hi> which can admit of no Bitterneſs, Strife, Recrimination, or ſuch Indecencies of Heat and Paſſion, which are the fatal Effects of Diſcord in the Church; and thus lets us ſee the Excellency of the <hi>Spirit and Rule</hi> of the Goſpel. II. That thus alſo we may know the Power and Efficacy of the Truth thereof, <hi>which is according to Godlineſs,</hi> upon Mens Hearts, in ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Diſtempers of the Mind and Judgment. III. That this doth ſo ſpecially tend to make Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>Lovely,</hi> and to draw forth matter of Praiſe and Bleſſing to God from the World, when they ſee ſuch a Native Effect of Chriſtianity as this, to make thoſe who profeſs the ſame in that manner ſhine forth in <hi>Tenderneſs, Humility, and Brotherly Love,</hi> ſo that they become as a Publick Good and Bleſsing to Mankind in the places they are in. IV. This appears alſo from the Nature of that <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Church of Chriſt,</hi> and amongſt his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, which only a Divine Power could both Frame and make Effectual; and it's ſure that no Humane Society or Conſtitution could ever claim ſuch an <hi>Unity</hi> therein as this is; where not only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all Nations and Languages, and of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, both high and low, but of the moſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Intereſts, Humours, and dividing Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in other things, do yet in ſo marvellous an <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> meet in the <hi>Body of Chriſt which is his Church</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:61707:30"/> here in the Earth. V. Becauſe herein alſo doth the Glory and Honour of our <hi>Bleſſed Head,</hi> more eminently appear in ſecuring this <hi>Unity</hi> of his Church, under a <hi>Diverſity of Light</hi> and Judgment otherways, by a Spirit of Love, Meekneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendence amongſt his People; than by impoſing the moſt ſevere and abſolute Uniformity in all things, to be the alone Condition of <hi>Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Qu. V. <hi>But what ſtrength and evidence doth this</hi> Demonſtration <hi>of the Goſpel, now bear in ſo</hi> divided a State <hi>of Religion, and when the wounds and breaches of the Church this day are like to bleed unto Death?</hi>

That none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Perfection of the <hi>Rule</hi> of the Goſpel, for there is a moſt firm and intire Unity amongſt all the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt on the Earth II. That no Oppoſition is made thereto, but what hath been <hi>foretold</hi> as one of the greateſt Tryals of the Church under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and the Spirit of God doth moſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly point at in theſe <hi>latter times.</hi> III. Becauſe the furtheſt <hi>Oppoſition</hi> thereto can be no more cauſe for any to ſtumble, or queſtion the Truth of this <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi> than whether there is a <hi>Devil,</hi> whoſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deſign hath ever been to divide and break Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians amongſt themſelves. IV. Becauſe this <hi>Union,</hi> which is chiefly <hi>Myſtical and Inviſible,</hi> is much greater often, than what this way may appear to the World, and of that kind as is not interrupted by diſtance of place, or any want of Local Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. V. That ſuch a <hi>guard</hi> is ſet by the Lord unto this piece of his Glory, to oppoſe any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61707:30"/> thereon, that there ſtands an <hi>Angel with a flaming Sword,</hi> upon every hand in the <hi>Commands</hi> and <hi>Threatnings</hi> of the Goſpel, to ſecure this Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Unity</hi> of the Saints amongſt themſelves, ſo as none can invade the ſame but on their higheſt Peril, of oppoſing that which is as the <hi>Apple of Chriſts eye.</hi> VI. That it's ever found that this Demonſtration hath ſome clear Evidence amongſt ſuch who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Diſciples of Chriſt,</hi> and according to their advance in the Life and Power of Chriſtianity doth the more brightly ſhine forth; ſo that the nearer the <hi>Lines</hi> are to the <hi>Centre,</hi> the nearer alſo are they amongſt themſelves. VII. That in all times there hath been ſome tremendous <hi>mark</hi> of the Judgment of God made viſible on ſuch who are <hi>Contentious,</hi> and have made it their work to <hi>Cauſe Diviſion</hi> in the Church and ſow diſcord among Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Qu. VI. <hi>But what hath the Church now in theſe latter days to Compenſate, and make up the want of that great Demonſtration by</hi> Miracles, <hi>and ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Confirmations of the Chriſtian Faith, as were in the firſt times?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I. We may hereby ſee that the <hi>Seal of Martyrdom,</hi> which came in the room of <hi>Miracles</hi> to the Church, hath exceeded that which was in the firſt times of the Goſpel. II. That there have been ſince ſuch innumerable <hi>ſhining Examples of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> yea theſe continued to this day, whom the World might ſee did walk in the Light and Power of Chriſtianity, as ſure as men walk, under the Power and Vertue of a living Soul. III. That we now ſee what a length the <hi>Courſe</hi> of the Goſpel and of the Church Militant is come, and how far thus the <hi>Times of the Gentiles are fulfilled,</hi> which once
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61707:31"/> was ſo contrary to all human Appearance. IV. That ſo ſure and exact a <hi>Performance of the Scripture,</hi> is now undeniable in the event, and of ſuch great and marvellous things which were foretold under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that in an ordinary way none could have believed, what we ſee with our Eyes; and now have theſe things, which were in former Ages the <hi>Object of the Churches Faith,</hi> been made the <hi>Object of our Senſe;</hi> and it's ſure this is ſuch <hi>a Seal</hi> and Confirmation to our Faith in theſe laſt times as doth much exceed the greateſt <hi>Miracles</hi> which were in the <hi>firſt Planting of the Goſpel.</hi> V. Though we may not reſolve our Faith on any <hi>Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Providences,</hi> or lay the leaſt weight hereon to ſupport the Authority of the Doctrine we profeſs, (ſince this only is founded on that Sacred Revelation of <hi>Divine Truth in the Scripture,</hi> which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule to diſcern true Miracles, and what is Gods Seal herein under the undoubted Signature and Stamp of his own Power and working in the ſame;) yet hath there been ſuch incontroulable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of extraordinary Signs and Confirmations to confirm the Truth of the Reformed Religion, ſince the Reformation, as in no Ages paſt was ever known, but with the firſt planting of the Goſpel among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though men looked but at a diſtance here or were come from <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> ſo far as to make a Serious Trial of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> it's ſure they could not but ſee, and be fully perſwaded in their Judgment hereof on theſe grounds. I. That a diſcovery is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and clear in the <hi>Scripture</hi> of ſo great things, as, that there is a <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and there be his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on Mens Souls, of <hi>Peace with God,</hi> and the <hi>Joy of his Preſence,</hi> which all who receive the Goſpel are called to know and prove on their own Trial. II. That this witneſs of Chriſtian <hi>Experience,</hi> hath as diſcernable a Conſent and Harmony therewith as Face anſwereth to Face in the Glaſs, and is clear to be no <hi>Caſual Thing,</hi> but every ſtep in this way of <hi>Trial,</hi> is by <hi>Scripture Light,</hi> and what Chriſtians did before read there, they know it now by Feelings on their own Souls. III. That this in all Ages of the <hi>Church</hi> and where-ever ſuch as ſerved God in the Spirit were found in the moſt <hi>remote parts</hi> from others, hath ſtill been the ſame; and like <hi>a great Roll</hi> is ſent down from one Generation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with their <hi>Confirmatory Seal, that God is faithful and true,</hi> in thoſe Truths of his Word which ſeem moſt incredible to the World, and now come to our hand to require the ſame Atteſtation and Witneſs. IV. That they who know and teſtifie theſe things, ſometimes found it not eaſie to believe the ſame, and did no leſs judge of ſuch <hi>great Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religion</hi> as a Dream or imaginary thing than moſt now do, until they knew them by Experience on their Soul. V. That ſuch alſo have been the moſt <hi>Burning and Shining Lights</hi> that ever were in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61707:32"/> the Church, and theſe innumerable in all Ages de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſame; and that in the Mouth of the Grave and entrance to an Eternal State when no outward Intereſt could ſway them hereto. VI. That it muſt be a matter of greateſt Aſſurance which hath then preſſed the moſt tender <hi>Parents</hi> with their laſt and dying Breath to commend the ſame <hi>Trial to their Children,</hi> and to charge their being earneſt herein as the greateſt Intereſt they could leave them. VII. That whatever <hi>Differences</hi> be oft among theſe in ſome matters of Truth: Yet, in the Certainty of this great Trial of the Life, Power and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Religion, there is an <hi>Harmonious Oneneſs</hi> in the ſame Teſtimony in all Times of the Church. VIII. That if any queſtion this, becauſe ſo remote from Mens <hi>Senſes,</hi> and the Judgment of Carnal Reaſon; the reality of its <hi>Effects,</hi> doth unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably prove both the <hi>Reality</hi> and <hi>Excellency of the Cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Qu.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though I ſhould ſtrive againſt the Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch a <hi>Miracle,</hi> and Demonſtration of the Goſpel, as <hi>Converſion</hi> is, yet were it not poſſible to deny ſuch demonſtrative Evidences as the World hath hereof. I. That it is ſure ſuch a <hi>Change</hi> is made eſſentially requiſite to the <hi>Being,</hi> and Conſtitution of a Chriſtian, by the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Scripture. II. That there was never yet an <hi>Argument in Nature,</hi> for ones being a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61707:32"/> in the Life and Power thereof: what ever may be for a naked form or ſhow. III. That they are not a <hi>few,</hi> but innumerable Inſtances in all times and of all Ranks and Conditions of Men on whom ſo great a <hi>Change</hi> and difference hath been made thus evident, both from themſelves what once they were, and from the reſidue of the World. IV. That this hath been not only upon ſuch as have been <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Impious</hi> in their Practice, but who in their Judgment were wont to deride Holineſs as a Fancy; ſo as <hi>Atheiſts</hi> muſt grant that there have been as profeſt <hi>Atheiſts</hi> ſometimes as themſelves, who have been made ſuch Conſpicuous Monuments of the Power of the Goſpel. V. That none can Object here, as once the <hi>Jews</hi> did, Do any of the <hi>Rulers,</hi> or ſuch as the World counts moſt <hi>wiſe,</hi> and knowing ſtand witneſſes to the ſame; when it is ſo known that there have not been more <hi>Wiſe, Learned,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious</hi> in the Things of Reaſon upon the Earth, than ſuch as have been eminent Examples of the Power of Converſion? VI. That its marvellous <hi>Effects</hi> in ſubduing men, from what once was their Predominant Intereſt and Idol, and to part from what had been as their <hi>right Eye, or Hand</hi> could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be from an Immediate Divine Power. VII. That ſuch as were greateſt Adverſaries to the Truth, have been made no leſs eminent <hi>Inſtruments</hi> in the Service of Chriſt, and choice Veſſels of Honour, than once they were in their Enmity and Oppoſition. VIII. That this Change hath been diſcernable in times of moſt Viſible Perſecutions and Hazard, when no outward Advantage or Gain could have the leaſt influence thereon. Now as theſe are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrably clear, ſo can there be no poſſible ground
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61707:33"/> to queſtion this. I. That the <hi>Scripture</hi> is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true in ſo great a diſcovery. II. That there is a <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> and a Power above nature, which accompanies the ſame in ſuch a change. III. That there are ſurely, <hi>contrary ſtates in another World,</hi> when they are ſo undeniably manifeſt here.</p>
                  <p>Qu. III. <hi>But can ſo great an experiment of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as that of</hi> Communion betwixt God and Men, <hi>here upon Earth be made rationally convincing to ſuch as are themſelves ſtrangers thereto; and for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirming of the Chriſtian Faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though this be an <hi>experiment</hi> of Divine Truth of a more tranſcendent intereſt and value than all that ever were in Nature, yet it is no leſs <hi>evident,</hi> and there can be no poſsible deluſion herein; if I. It's that to which ſo <hi>innumerable a Company</hi> bears Teſtimony and hath ſent down the ſame, as that which not once or twice they have approved but in the continued trial of their Life. II. That it's known to the World, that ſuch as teſtifie what they do, and have ſo oft found in the retirement of their Souls with God, are of as <hi>diſcerning Spirits</hi> to know the true value of things, as any elſe; yea ſuch whoſe teſtimony in other things the worſt of men could not refuſe nor deny. III. That it's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably evident, ſuch muſt have another acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and <hi>ſociety than that of men;</hi> which not only makes theſe hidden exerciſes of godlineſs ſo deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, (where all may ſee they more flee than follow any humane Witneſs,) but alſo makes ſo viſible a change both in their caſe and countenance after moſt ſad anguiſh and down-caſtings of Spirit. IV. That it is ſo evident alſo how ſuch as are moſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61707:33"/> ſerious this way, have been viſibly oft raiſed above their ordinary caſe, and frame in Prayer, and other duties of Religion; yea, in that manner, as they who never knew there is a <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, could not withſtand ſo clear conviction of the reality hereof, that can beget ſuch <hi>liberty, humble tenderneſs</hi> and melting of Heart, yea ſuch diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy and confidence. V. That no deluſion or falſe ſhew can be here, when it's ever ſeen, that ſuch as are moſt ſerious and frequent in <hi>Prayer</hi> and theſe hid retirements with God, are the moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing alſo in the <hi>vitals</hi> of Chriſtianity, and have the moſt honourable luſtre, and appearance of any in their profeſſion. VI. That it's ſuch only whoſe joy and comfort is moſt ſpecially diſcernable beyond others, when theſe lower ſprings of outward help and encouragement are moſt viſibly ſhut up.</p>
                  <p>Qu. IV. <hi>Is that great, and experimental part of Religion in the</hi> Power of the Conſcience <hi>over man, ſuch as may be as demonſtrable to the World, as the truth of a rational Being?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may be matter of wonder that men are not ſtruck with deeper convictions hereon, when they cannot but ſee. I. That though this be the greateſt <hi>tormentor,</hi> and troubler of the World, yet is there no poſſible retreat from its power, tho' men ſhould flee to the uttermoſt parts of the Earth, but doth it enforce the Soul to a <hi>reflexion on its ſelf,</hi> even when it trembleth at that ſight. II. That it cauſeth great fear and horrour upon the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>ſecret ſins,</hi> when no dread of Humane Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or of viſible hazard this way could occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it. III. That it admits no violence in any to out-dare the ſame, but is a power that the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61707:34"/> Monarchs</hi> find to be ſtronger than they; and is ſuch, that theſe oft are enforced for preſent eaſe, and relief either to divert, or bribe the ſame by ſome falſe grounds of peace. IV. That it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains men to <hi>Juſtifie God,</hi> and <hi>Judge themſelves,</hi> (when his hand doth purſue them,) and to find out their ſin, and guilt, which was before hid. V. That it makes men alſo afraid to be <hi>alone</hi> with themſelves; and to tremble at the Word of Truth, becauſe its <hi>light doth torment them,</hi> by that una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable application which Conſcience makes hereof. VI. Yea it makes mens guilt ſo legible oft in their countenance, (even when they ſtudy moſt to conceal it,) that all may ſee there is an accuſer within, whoſe Authority and Power cannot poſſibly be declined. VII. That with ſo remarkable a <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>ſecurity,</hi> it doth ſupport Mens Spirit, and makes it eaſie to ſuſtain its greateſt infirmities from without, when it is a Friend; yea, and upholds the oppreſt with unſpeakable Peace and Comfort, when it doth oft cauſe the oppreſſour to tremble.</p>
                  <p>Qu. V. <hi>But what doth moſt neceſſarily reſult from ſo clear a demonſtration as the</hi> Conſcience <hi>is, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of our Faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. That it's infallibly thus clear, that there is a <hi>Higher Power</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> to which all mankind is ſubjected, and gives the World an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable demonſtration, both of the being of <hi>God,</hi> and of the <hi>Truth of his Word,</hi> in the great and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural diſcovery which it makes hereof. II. That there is a Supream and Infallible Law alſo and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Judge above us, under whoſe power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority this <hi>Court of Juſtice</hi> doth (without reſpect of Perſons) both <hi>Summon, Arreſt,</hi> bring in <hi>Witneſs</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:61707:34"/> and <hi>Sentence</hi> great and ſmall. III. That the <hi>Internal Government</hi> of our <hi>Bleſſed Lord,</hi> this way (both in the ſeverity of his rebukes and moſt ſenſible enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Peace and Comfort) is unavoidably demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. IV. That it bears ſo clear evidence to unknown and undoubted <hi>relief,</hi> and none elſe could be ever found, for theſe Wounds and Stings of the Conſcience, but in the <hi>Light and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Chriſtianity.</hi> V. That it is ſimply impoſſible for men to delight freely in a courſe of ſin, when no Humane Power can diſarm the Conſcience of that ſo intolerable <hi>a ſting,</hi> by which it begins ſo early a Hell within the Soul. VI. That ſuch is the Power and Peace of a good Conſcience, as can make it ſtand unbroken amidſt the greateſt ruins and terrours of the World, when under ſuch a guard as that of its own <hi>innocency.</hi>

That he is ſo manifeſt in his appearance as a <hi>Spirit of Blaſphemy,</hi> which impetuouſly acts Men to War againſt Heaven with their <hi>Tongue</hi> in ſuch Oaths and Curſing as have no ſenſual pleaſure, or gain herein; yea, as a <hi>Spirit of Deluſion</hi> in ſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an excitement of others to ſuch extravagancies (under a ſhew of Religion,) as are inconſiſtent with any uſe of Judgment or Reaſon.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. It is plain that ſuch a Party both in their Nature and continued Actings, are in a ſtared oppoſition to the Kingdom of Chriſt. II. It is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the <hi>Prey</hi> which theſe Mighty Hunters do follow after, is not our <hi>Body,</hi> or the things of this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61707:35"/> Life, but it is the <hi>Immortal Soul,</hi> and <hi>Future State,</hi> that Man might be made ſharer of the ſame Miſery under which they are concluded. III. All may ſee their being under reſtraint of a Supream Power above them, and under ſuch <hi>Chains</hi> as do irreſiſtibly bound their <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>enmity</hi> againſt Man, by an <hi>inviſible Guard</hi> and <hi>Hedge</hi> which they cannot break over. IV. Their greateſt rage, and ſtrugling is againſt the <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of ſinners to God, and to hold faſt his poſſeſſion in ſuch, as the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> doth not more clearly move for their reſcue, than theſe do to croſs that bleſſed deſign of the Goſpel.

That by the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and within the Precinct of the Church, there is diſcernably a much greater <hi>reſtraint of Satans Dominion</hi> and Power than in all the Earth beſides; yea that the advantage of being within the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal covenant of Baptiſm,</hi> is ſo demonſtrable that the leaſt yielding or tendency to a renouncing of the ſame, (or any Acts of <hi>Homage,</hi>) for making uſe of his help, hath ever made way for ſome more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Power of the <hi>Devil</hi> over ſuch than others.

That there is ſuch an <hi>Immaterial and Active Subſtance</hi> as the <hi>Soul,</hi> which can admit of no cauſe, either of its decay or diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, from the Body; yea that the greateſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this viſible Creation, is here, that ſuch a vital <hi>Beam of Life, Light,</hi> and <hi>Immortality,</hi> as the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man is therein.

III. That it can have no dependance on the Body in its Being, which doth no way depend thereon in its Actings and Exerciſe; but is oft moſt vigorous and clear, in its exerciſe, not only when moſt <hi>ſeparate</hi> and abſtract from ſenſible things, but when the <hi>fleſh</hi> is under the greateſt decay, and near its <hi>diſſolution;</hi> to ſhew the <hi>Soul</hi> lieth not a dying with the Body, but hath its <hi>diſtinct ſubſiſtence,</hi> to live in a ſeparate ſtate, when it dies. IV. Its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peculiarly framed for converſe, and intercourſe with ſpiritual Beings, yea its being the only part of the viſible Creation admitted to fellowſhip with the inviſible God, and to have reflex acts upon it ſelf. V. It is a <hi>Being</hi> of a higher nature and value than the Sun Moon and Stars; which not only can know,

VI. It is ſuch a Being, as is capable of a happineſs beyond the whole extent of the World, and hath theſe intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Faculties, which cannot poſsibly want, both objects ſuitable thereto, and injoyments above the Senſes. VII. The moſt choice and excellent, are uſually moſt afflicted, and cruſhed under the feet of their oppreſſours, whilſt the vileſt flouriſh in the Earth and have no bands in their death, ſo that ſuch were of all men the moſt miſerable, if in this life both their being and bleſſedneſs were terminated. VIII. That there is ſo <hi>univerſal a ſenſe</hi> of <hi>Immortality,</hi> that they who both fear and hate the evidences hereof, yet under ſome conſtraint of Reaſon, have the ſame for a continued terrour. IX. That it is ſure the <hi>certainty of death,</hi> makes it ſimply impoſsible, for things only ſuited to this Life of Senſe, to be the ultimate good, or fruition of Man; ſince elſe the <hi>Beaſts</hi> ſhould have a greater happineſs than ſuch, if it were not for reſpect to an after and <hi>Immortal State.</hi>

                  <p>Qu. IV. <hi>What confirmation to your Faith does that great and amazing change by</hi> Death <hi>offer, when it would ſeem to be ſomething meerly</hi> natural?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though the only wiſe God moves here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in according to the nature of ſecond cauſes, and it hath various ways of approach unto men, yet
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61707:37"/> may all ſee with the furtheſt conviction of rational evidence, as well as certainty of Faith, I. That <hi>Death in its firſt conſtitution is Penal;</hi> and comes by a Divine appointment unto all, not meerly as men, but as ſinners; and to be no <hi>natural accident</hi> and reſult of our Primitive and Original Frame. II. That it's <hi>Death</hi> as a <hi>Penalty</hi> which keeps the fear and dread thereof ſo much on all living, it being in that laſt period, that the eternal ſtate of Men is deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. III. That the <hi>ſting</hi> and bitterneſs of ſin, is ſo manifeſt in innumerable diſeaſes and ſtroaks of Death, which many feel an 100. times ere they <hi>dye</hi> once, beyond any other of the Creatures. IV. Though the Sentence of <hi>dying</hi> is on all, yet ſo great a difference is betwixt the Saints and reſidue of Men here, that its <hi>penal</hi> execution on the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is ſuch as nature can give no ſupport under it. V. That <hi>ſupernatural preſages</hi> and warnings hereof ere it come, are in all times known and ſure; yea ſuch extraordinary evidences are ſometimes of the preciſe time, as could have no poſſible riſe from any <hi>natural cauſe.</hi> VI. That its immediate <hi>commiſſion</hi> from a ſupream and <hi>Inviſible Power,</hi> is ſo evident in ſuch executions oft, of this Sentence, by <hi>Sword, Famine</hi> and <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> as the viſible <hi>Finger of God,</hi> in a juſt retribution unto men for ſin, may be no leſs ſeen, (and a ſupernatural <hi>cauſality,</hi>) than the effects have been undoubted and clear; to ſhew that ſuch is the ſtate of Man, that this great revolution by <hi>Death,</hi> doth each moment depend on a call from Heaven. VII. That the certainty of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>ſupernatural</hi> in this King of Terrours, is ſo known that as no relief can poſſibly be found, but in the <hi>truth and power of Chriſtianity,</hi> to ſet men
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61707:37"/> both above the fear of Death and an after State, when once it comes near. VIII. Yea that it is ſurely above the poſſibility of Nature, which can bear out in this great adventure and <hi>trial</hi> of Mens <hi>Faith,</hi> both in the truth and ſtrength thereof, at <hi>Death;</hi> for which end the Lord hath thus choſen that by ſo ſtrange an <hi>entry,</hi> and at ſo dark a Port they ſhould firſt paſs to the full enjoyment of that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtate above.</p>
                  <p>Qu. V. <hi>What</hi> evidence <hi>and</hi> demonſtration <hi>can you ſhew, to confirm ſo great a Faith of an</hi> Eternal Glory <hi>prepared for the Saints in Heaven, and of its</hi> earneſt <hi>and</hi> firſt fruits <hi>here, as may ſtrike an undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conviction hereof on the World?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. The viſible <hi>ripening</hi> and reſemblance to ſuch a ſtate in all the degrees of a Chriſtians growth, to a more <hi>full ſtature of the man in Chriſt,</hi> may be no leſs evident than the natural growth of our Body. II. Though the opening of theſe <hi>Gates</hi> of the <hi>Second World</hi> be hid, (ſo as no humane ſenſe can diſcern the <hi>Spirit</hi> in its <hi>aſcent</hi> through thoſe higher Regions, to that unconceivable <hi>Paradiſe and Glory</hi> in the <hi>Third Heaven,</hi>) yet is the <hi>triumphant entry</hi> and paſſage of innumerable Chriſtians at death, ſuch as hath oft been a matter of ſenſe and cleareſt evidence to the World. III. Such alſo were both <hi>humble, tender,</hi> and <hi>ſincere</hi> in their Life, and then in ſo great a compoſure of judgement, that all might ſee they knew what made them glad, and could ſwallow up both the fears and bitterneſs of Death; yea and this was not given for their own ſupport only, but for a more <hi>publick uſe,</hi> for the Conviction and Confirmation of others. IV. The ſtate of glory is demonſtrable and hath been oft
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61707:38"/> brought down to Mens ſenſe, by theſe <hi>raviſhing joys of the Martyrs of Chriſt,</hi> and exultation of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit even in the <hi>Flames.</hi> V. Supernatural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts attend the Life of Chriſtianity, and can have no poſſible riſe from the fleſh and outward cauſes, with that <hi>Joy and Peace,</hi> which by ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural a reſult follows <hi>well-doing,</hi> and any ſervice of love for Chriſt; which all may ſee to be the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> of that harveſt which is above. VI. Rare and marvellous a frame of the <hi>new man,</hi> ſet up in this lower Region of Grace, in ſo diſcernable a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the bleſſed God, and reſemblance to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtate than here, to which the World is but as a place of Pilgrimage, trial and a <hi>preparatory ſtate</hi> only. VII. Viſible returns of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort Chriſtians have after ſaddeſt conflicts and down-caſtings, and ſuch day-break of <hi>vital quickening beams of Divine Light,</hi> that have often been no leſs evident, than that of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> at the Stake, who cried out, <hi>Now he is come, he is come.</hi> VIII. Their <hi>breathings of Love</hi> after an unſeen Chriſt and viſible effects of its power on men, might ſhew ſome begun <hi>tranſlation</hi> of the Soul ſo far herein, as to be more where it loves than where it lives. IX. Though we cannot ſee here, that <hi>ineffable glory,</hi> which is above, but ſhould have our <hi>Faith</hi> inſtead of <hi>Eyes;</hi> yet ſuch is the truth of <hi>holineſs,</hi> as doth not only evidence, but in its own nature partake of a <hi>future glory;</hi> ſo as every degree and act thereof doth enter in a begun ſtate of <hi>fruition</hi> and bleſſedneſs, and makes it ſimply impoſſible for a <hi>good man</hi> in any true exerciſe of Godlineſs, <hi>not to be happy alſo,</hi> and thus in a more near capacity to know that <hi>joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable,</hi> and <hi>full of glory,</hi> which is above. X. By
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61707:38"/> ſo ſure, known, and tryed a paſſage betwixt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Mens Souls in <hi>Prayer,</hi> with ſo ſetled a Trade of <hi>commerce</hi> this way, and certain returns, as with aſſurance ſuch can ſay, though they muſt <hi>change their place,</hi> yet not their <hi>company.</hi> XI. The whole diſpenſations of Providence in <hi>Iſraels paſſage</hi> through the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> and to ſo excellent a Country as <hi>Canaan,</hi> is no leſs ſure in its ſelf, than that it was given for an Embleme and <hi>Type</hi> of the journying and militant ſtate of the Saints here, and to be a ſolemn pledge of that <hi>Canaan above.</hi> XII. Such is the Magnificence, Harmony and Order of theſe viſible <hi>Heavens,</hi> and <hi>Celeſtial Bodies</hi> there, with their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>glory,</hi> (though all illuminated from the ſame Fountain of Light the Sun) as we may judge by a <hi>Divine Ordination</hi> to have ſome peculiar reſpect to that end, to awake and raiſe our thoughts to theſe <hi>higher Regions of Glory,</hi> which are above all theſe, by what is thus viſible to our Eyes; where the redeemed of the Lord ſhall be ever fixed, and <hi>ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Qu. VI. <hi>What viſible and awakening</hi> evidences <hi>are there of the truth of an</hi> Hell, <hi>and that ſtate of</hi> horrour <hi>and</hi> torment <hi>in another World, which even to mens</hi> ſenſes <hi>here, might preſent the certainty thereof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. That it can be no more ſure, that there is ſuch a power and party as that of the <hi>Devils,</hi> than the reality of ſome ſuch a <hi>horrid Region</hi> and place alſo, to which they belong, and are adjudged to. II. From ſo innumerable a company of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race,</hi> as are not in the viſible ſervice of theſe <hi>Infernal Spirits,</hi> but partakers of the ſame nature
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61707:39"/> and <hi>enmity</hi> againſt the <hi>Holy God</hi> and his <hi>Image,</hi> which doth clearly witneſs their reſpect and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the ſame <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy in their <hi>judgment,</hi> as here in their <hi>ſin.</hi> III. Such viſible impreſſions of <hi>vindictive juſtice</hi> are on mens Souls, with ſuch <hi>horrour of Conſcience</hi> and unſufferable torments this way, as in all Ages have been known by moſt remarkable inſtances, (when not in the leaſt diſtemper of their natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,) that may preſent to mens <hi>Senſes</hi> ſomething of a <hi>viſible Hell,</hi> as convincingly, as if one had <hi>riſen from the Dead,</hi> for the ſame. IV. A trembling <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>terror of Divine Vengeance,</hi> oft follows upon <hi>horrid acts of wickedneſs,</hi> and ſo eminently breaks forth upon a ſurpriſing ſight of <hi>Death,</hi> that all may ſee ſomething more dreadful here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in than in the diſſolution of Nature; and the Power and preſent Arreſt of a <hi>future judgment</hi> is made viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the ſame. V. There are begun degrees, of <hi>blaſpheming and rage</hi> againſt God, becauſe of his <hi>plagues,</hi> and ſuch <hi>prodigies of cruelty</hi> exerciſed by Men here in the Earth, as may be evident to all to be more than humane, and rather the effects of infernal ſpirits acting in a humane ſhape. VI. So clear a <hi>prelude</hi> and beginning of Hell, is in that judicial <hi>obduration,</hi> and blindneſs, which many are given up to, (under the greateſt diſcoveries of light,) that all may ſee their being thus bound over in <hi>Chains,</hi> and ſhut up in <hi>Priſon,</hi> until <hi>Death</hi> bring them forth to the <hi>Execution;</hi> and that no relief or application of the means of Grace hath then any ſucceſs. VII. Such a Map and Shadow of <hi>Eternal Vengeance,</hi> is in theſe terrible acts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Judgment inflicted here on <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61707:39"/> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and other flagitious perſons, which with the very firſt view might preſent an awful and immediate appearance of God in the ſame, ſome <hi>ſtrange</hi> and ſupernatural <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is oft ſo viſible on the <hi>workers of Iniquity.</hi> VIII. And (whatever be of natural cauſes in ſuch viſible repreſentations here in the Earth, as that <hi>ſulphureous Lake</hi> where once <hi>Sodom</hi> was, and thoſe burning Mountains of <hi>Haecla, Aetna,</hi> and <hi>Veſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>) yet we may truly judge that they are thus ſet before the World as viſible memorials of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Flames;</hi> and as it were ſo many Chimny's or Vent-holes thereof, for ſuch who will not believe the ſame, becauſe they do not yet ſee or feel ſuch a thing.</p>
                  <p>Qu. VII. <hi>What</hi> aſſiſtances <hi>hath our</hi> Faith, <hi>of that great and wonderful truth of the</hi> Reſurrection of the Body, <hi>after its diſſolution in the</hi> Grave unto Duſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. It hath great aſſiſtance from that viſible and ſtupendious frame of the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Earth,</hi> when it's ſure that the ſame <hi>Infinite Power,</hi> that hath not only made Man, but the whole Creation, can as eaſily collect and reunite the diſperſed <hi>aſhes</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> as <hi>form the ſame.</hi> II. From that greateſt pledge here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the <hi>Reſurrection of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> III. From that tribulation and ſore pain, that the Saints here in their outward man are expoſed to, ſince it is ſure that in the holy juſtice of God, he did not give ſuch <hi>Bodies</hi> for <hi>labour,</hi> and for toil, and to his <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> to endure unexpreſſible torments for Chriſt, at laſt to periſh for ever.

That the <hi>Trials</hi> of a Church, ſhould be ſuited to the meaſure of their <hi>Talent of Light,</hi> and when this hath been in ſome more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way diſpenſed, that ſome remarkably <hi>ſearching Times</hi> might be expected to follow; nor can it be now ſtrange to us, that ſuch things fall in with this <hi>day,</hi> which did not meet the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> at the <hi>firſt entry of the Reformation,</hi> who then had not ſo clear Diſcoveries of the Truth, and that meaſure of <hi>Confirmation</hi> therein, which hath been ſince.

That ſome unuſual <hi>Tryals,</hi> and <hi>Conflicts,</hi> in the Lords Method of Providence, ſhould be ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo, to the greatneſs of that <hi>Work,</hi> which he is bringing forth, may be no ſtrange thing; and to ſee a time of ſuch ſore wreſtlings as this, when all things ſeem to cry, and <hi>be in Pain,</hi> as <hi>Micah</hi> 4.20. Yea when ſome great <hi>event</hi> of the Scripture is to be revealed to the World, and near to its <hi>full height,</hi> and <hi>Period of Accompliſhment,</hi> (as we have ſafe ground for Aſſurance of this day.) III. Nor hath this ſad and diſmal hour on the Church, been more obvious than the <hi>provoking Cauſe</hi> hereof, in which the <hi>Holy Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> may be no leſs clear, than the <hi>Cloud</hi> now is dark; when there has been ſuch a Viſible falling off from that <hi>Love, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> and <hi>Power of Religion,</hi> that did formerly attend its Profeſſion; for theſe many years paſt we might have ſeen that ſome ſore and remarkable Judgment was coming, and that if we had not been in <hi>ſuch a manner undone,</hi> we were, under ſome ſadder ſtroak of Spiritual Judgment, ready to <hi>be utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</hi> IV.

In how few years alſo, there was, as a <hi>new Chriſtian World</hi> brought forth, in that ſwift Courſe and Progreſs which the ingathering of the Reformed Churches had, ſo as between the Year 1560, and 1621. ſuch famous <hi>Plantations</hi> of the Goſpel were ſetled in a Church-ſtate; which all may ſee was the immediate Work and Power of God; to ſhew that none ſhould fear, or <hi>ſtagger at his Promiſe;</hi> though the waters yet ſwell, and come to the <hi>flowings</hi> of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties appear unſuperable to humane Sence, after theſe great things which the Lord hath done, III.

And can the moſt diſmal things of this time, countervail the <hi>Confirmations of our Faith,</hi> who have ſo clearly ſeen, with the firſt breaking up of the <hi>Purer Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Power and Life of Chriſtianity</hi> came therewith to the World, as a <hi>Seal,</hi> and Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation thereto, beyond any <hi>Miracles;</hi> yea how innumerable a Company, in theſe laſt Ages of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Tongues and Languages, and theſe ſo remote from one another, did not only receive the ſame Truth, but with ſuch Reſolution Adventure their Souls thereon, as might fully witneſs, they had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſpect of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and to be in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner raviſhed with the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> of the ſame, than is now in theſe times: VI. Such high <hi>Spring tides</hi> of the <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of the Goſpel, might be evident to all, after ſo ſad a reſtraint had been for ſo many Ages before, under <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> darkneſs; for whatever was then as a <hi>Private Seal,</hi> on the Spirit of Chriſtians whilſt the Witneſſes did <hi>Propheſie in Sack-cloth,</hi> yet was there no ſuch Evidence and <hi>Demonſtration of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or a <hi>Publick Confirmatory Seal</hi> to the Truth, as was after the <hi>Reformation.</hi> VII. Yea was it not the moſt Sober, Serious, and Inquiſitive Part of Men, upon a ſure Trial of the Grounds of their Faith, who did moſt firmly imbrace the ſame; and how many of theſe alſo were of the greateſt Parts and Abilities, whom none could Judge to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſo far herein, without the higheſt Aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that this was their undoubted intereſt and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. VIII. We have ſeen not only men of mean
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61707:43"/> and low Eſtate, but ſuch of the <hi>Higheſt</hi> Place and <hi>Quality,</hi> moſt chearfully adventuring whatever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt could be deareſt to them in the Earth, for the Truths ſake; yea it was ever found, that ſuch as were moſt acquainted with the Reformed Religion in its Power, and lived up in their Practice to what they profeſſed thereof, were thoſe who with the greateſt Aſſurance, moſt reſolutely ſtill adhered thereto. IX. We have ſeen alſo, its moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſpreading in the World, when there could be no poſſible pretence of a <hi>Worldly Intereſt,</hi> or Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Motives for the ſame. X, We have ſeen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing not only extraordinary, but even <hi>Miraculous</hi> in the <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Reſolution</hi> of innumerable <hi>Martyrs</hi> ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> who did bear out with a more than humane ſtrength, againſt a cruelty ſo viſibly <hi>Inhumane,</hi> and Savage; yea which did in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees exceed that meaſure of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> as being againſt a greater Light than theirs. XI. And have we not ſeen of what Spirit, ſuch ſtill have been ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> who were the moſt notorious Inſtruments in the Churches Perſecution, and how viſibly ſuch did act herein, under ſo impetuous an incitement of the <hi>Devil,</hi> that as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his <hi>Apology</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Nero,</hi> the Truth might boaſt in having ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. XII. It is ſure we have ſeen, that no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Power, could yet ever undo this bleſſed Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> tho' no way, or change of Weapons, hath been left untried; but we have thus ſeen, whither ſo ſtrong, and united a Confederacy, as the <hi>Catholick League</hi> in <hi>France</hi> did at laſt reſolve, and not only in the ruine of the greateſt Actors and Contrivers therein, but to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61707:43"/> eſtabliſhing of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> there, as though ſuch had Intentionally acted for the ſame; when if <hi>ſecond Cauſes</hi> had brought forth their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary effects, it might have been judged impoſſible to fail. XIII. We have ſeen that iſſue of all the Councels, Expence and Cruelty of <hi>Philip the</hi> II. <hi>of Spain,</hi> to bear down the Truth of the Goſpel in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which was to the furtheſt ſetling of this <hi>Illuſtrious State</hi> and the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> there; yea how their Conſpicuous Riſe and Flouriſhing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Externals, and their reſolute adherence to the Truth of Chriſt did moſt viſibly keep toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. XIV. We know that <hi>deluge of Blood,</hi> which ſo quickly followed the <hi>French Maſſacre;</hi> and the moſt diſmal time which ever that <hi>Nation</hi> knew, did then viſibly Contemporate, with ſuch a time of their greateſt Rage and Perſecution againſt the Truth, and that Event of the <hi>Third Vial</hi> moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfilled herein, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.5, 6. <hi>Thou art Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, O Lord, which art, and waſt, and ſhalt be, becauſe thou haſt judged thus, for they have ſhed the Blood of thy Saints and Prophets, and thou haſt given them Blood to drink in great meaſure.</hi> XV. Yea have we not ſeen how <hi>four Kings of</hi> France Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, were in leſs than thirty years, taken away, in the ſame continued purſuit, how to deſtroy the Church there, in whom that whole race of the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois</hi> was thus extinct; yea in the manner of their Death, were moſt remarkable Monuments of Divine Judgment, as the moſt famous Writers of that time do atteſt. XVI. We have ſeen what marvellous effects did follow thoſe Bloody Years of <hi>Queen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s <hi>Reign</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to promote and commend the Proteſtant Doctrine to Mens Conſciences there,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61707:44"/> with ſo great a Triumph as it had in the Sufferings of ſuch choice and excellent witneſſes for Chriſt, and hath brought in more Rent to the Praiſe and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Bleſſed Head, than may to the furtheſt compenſe all that Blood of the Saints there, though highly <hi>Precious in the Eyes of the Lord.</hi> XVII. We have ſeen likewiſe the Blood and Cruelty of late, againſt the Proteſtants in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in a ſhort time moſt Viſibly returned on the Authors thereof, and how the immediate Finger of God might be ſeen in calling forth the <hi>Swedes</hi> to avenge the ſame, and in that deſolating ſtroak which followed in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> XVIII. We have ſeen in theſe late Times the Iſſue of that horrid <hi>Maſſacre</hi> on the <hi>Proteſtants in Ireland,</hi> to the utter ruine (in a very few years after,) of that Barbarous Party, who had thus acted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. XIX. We have ſeen what wonderful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences did attend the actings of that poor handful of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the <hi>Valleys of Piedmont</hi> ſince the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> upon the account of that Bloody <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre</hi> which was ſet on foot there againſt them, which was ſo aſtoniſhing as all might ſee an extraordinary Appearance of the Lord herein, as is clearly atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by the moſt Faithful Hiſtories of that time. XX. And can it be forgot unto this day, how viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a Divine Hand did appear in breaking that great <hi>Spaniſh Armado,</hi> in the Year 1588. which had been for ſome years in Contriving againſt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> XXI. Aſtoniſhing, and ſpecially Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative of the immediate Power and Preſence of God, and matter of Wonder and Praiſe alſo for after Ages, was that ſolemn time of the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Church in Scotland,</hi> for planting the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion</hi> there; with that zeal and oneneſs of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61707:44"/> Spirit, as did then appear in all ranks to imbrace and adhere to the Profeſſion thereof, amidſt the greateſt threatnings of their Adverſaries; ſo as a <hi>few Years</hi> did bring forth that, which would have ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrange for an <hi>Age</hi> to accompliſh; yea that we find betwixt the laſt <hi>Martyr</hi> for the Truth there, who was <hi>burnt</hi> at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> 1558. and the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and full abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of <hi>Popery,</hi> with the full Concurrence of <hi>Civil Authority</hi> herein, in <hi>July</hi> 1560. was but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle above two Years, to ſhew what great things the Lord can do, above all Humane Council or Confidence. XXII. It's ſure we have ſeen in what remarkable degrees theſe <hi>laſt Vials</hi> of the Holy Judgment of God, have taken place on the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and how Conſpicuous the <hi>Event</hi> hath been of that <hi>Prophecy,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.8. in theſe great Effects and Conſumption thereof by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Goſpel, as an aſſured Pledge of the full Accompliſhment of what remains herein. XXIII. And as every ſtep of the Churches Riſe, hath been ſtill advanced in a continued, Conflict betwixt the <hi>Truth and Antichriſt,</hi> ſo have we ſtill ſeen, when the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault and Oppoſition hath been greateſt, its moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable tendency to a greater Victory; which were it rightly conſidered upon clear and ſolid grounds from the Scripture, the moſt formidable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Trouble from this Adverſary would with more Comfort than Fear this day be looked on; ſo that whatever be the neareſt and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate events, yet is it ſure, as <hi>the Lord is true,</hi> (whoſe Word is paſſed hereon,) that whoſoever gives their Power and Strength to ſupport that Intereſt of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall loſe the day, and find their Cauſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61707:45"/> deſperate, for the party with whom they contend herein is the Son of God, againſt whom no humane Power ſhall ever be able to ſtand. Theſe are but a <hi>few,</hi> which are here mentioned, of the great <hi>Acts of our God,</hi> in behalf of his Truth, to be ſtill as preſent in our ſight, in a time when the Spirits of many are ready to Stagger and Faint; and here mentioned, to lay no ſtreſs or weight of the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the Truth and Doctrine of our Profeſſion thereon, but on the alone <hi>Revelation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> but they are ſuch an undeniable Seal for Confirming our Faith, and of ſo known, <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>famous Evidence,</hi> as ſhould be no leſs conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and taken to Heart now, than in the time when the Lord thus appeared herein.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61707:45"/> theſe latter days; nor can there be any pretence, to ſeek another <hi>Light,</hi> (either from the <hi>Stars</hi> above, or the <hi>Diviners</hi> of this Time,) when ſo woful a Trade hath got up in the World, that men wtll thus go <hi>to the God of</hi> Ekron, as though there were not a <hi>God in</hi> Iſrael, or ſuch a thing, as his <hi>written Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> to inquire at, when it's ſure theſe lie open, and with a clear and diſtinct ſound ſpeak to all who have a Serious and Unprejudged Spirit. I. That the <hi>Church</hi> under the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> hath now paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and gone through that moſt diſmal and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Tryal</hi> herein, which was to go over her Head under <hi>Antichriſts Reign</hi> and <hi>Height,</hi> and whatever appearance he now hath in great Wrath, yet is it ſure and evident that the <hi>Winter is paſt</hi> and the <hi>Churches Spring</hi> begun; and a few ſteps further off, that Judgment which is now haſtning on, will at length end the quarrel; ſo that by a near converſe with the Word, we may clearly ſee from what <hi>point</hi> the <hi>Churches courſe</hi> and motion this day lies, and how exactly it keeps, in the Certainty thereof, by the clear <hi>Conduct</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures of Truth,</hi> where a full <hi>Map</hi> of her whole <hi>Courſe</hi> and Paſſage through Time is clearly ſhewed. II. That we may now with ſome clear Evidence Judge, and have our Faith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded hereof, that the <hi>Churches</hi> Intereſt is upon the <hi>riſing Hand,</hi> and on a preſent Advance, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would ſeem more Contradictory than all viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grounds now are; ſince this cannot fail, <hi>John</hi> 3.30.

That when ſo Conſpicuous a ſtep of the <hi>Churches Victory</hi> is near; the Oppoſition thereto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo will be in ſome higher degree proportionable to the ſame, when the great men of the Earth, and ſuch <hi>who ſhall receive Power as Kings, one hour with the Beaſt,</hi> ſhall have one Mind, and give <hi>their Power and Strength thereto,</hi> and <hi>ſhall make War with the Lamb, but the Lamb ſhall overcome them, for he is King of Kings and Lord of Lords,</hi> &amp;c. Nor is it found through the <hi>Scripture</hi> where the Lord hath done any <hi>great thing</hi> for his Church, but ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual <hi>darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſore-wreſtlings</hi> have ſtill gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſhould be no matter of ſtaggering to our Faith, (whatever it be of preſent Fears,) to ſee ſo diſmal a <hi>Time of Tryal</hi> as now is, and amazing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61707:46"/> heighth of trouble beyond what former times have known, when one of the <hi>greateſt events</hi> of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in behalf of the Church, ſince the revealing of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the World, until his <hi>ſecond coming,</hi> is aſſuredly near in the fall and overthrow of the <hi>man of Sin.</hi> IV. We have clear ground alſo to judge, that ſo great an <hi>Eclipſe</hi> as ſeems almoſt Univerſally over the State of the Reformed <hi>Churches,</hi> is no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>down of the Sun</hi> thereon, (whatever did befal the moſt famous <hi>Eaſtern Churches</hi> to an utter diſſipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof;) if theſe different <hi>Periods</hi> of time be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, how their <hi>Sun-ſet</hi> did then fall in with the <hi>Entry</hi> of that <hi>great Apoſtacy</hi> of the Chriſtian Church and with that long and diſmal Night of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts Reign;</hi> whilſt now this hour of Trial on the Churches, doth meet in that bleſſed <hi>Period of Antichriſts begun fall,</hi> and of a growing Light of the Goſpel, and when the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſo clearly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants our Faith herein, that the Work of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is to <hi>Plant,</hi> and not <hi>cut off,</hi> but to bring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that Intereſt of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> in the founding of which the <hi>Mediator</hi> hath ſo eminently appeared in the Glory of his Power in theſe <hi>last times.</hi> V. It is ſure we now live in the Evening, and Extremity of time, when the motions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence may be expected to be more quick and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as being ſo near the Centre, and to the laſt <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocha,</hi> and Period of all <hi>Prophetick Chronology;</hi> wherein the Glory of God in his Truth and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs ſhall moſt eminently ſhine forth, and theſe Scripture Truths which were formerly dark and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe, with that Evidence ſhine forth in the event, as ſhall cauſe men to wonder at their former thoughts and ſtumblings thereat. And here I muſt ſay, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61707:47"/> there is ſuch a ſight now in the Earth, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church,</hi> in its Complex frame and ſtate, in ſo different a mold caſt from any Power or Juriſdiction elſe, and ſuch a Compound of a <hi>Civil, and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Monarchy</hi> in one and the ſame Perſon, is ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and undeniable a <hi>Seal</hi> to the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and <hi>Divinity of the New Teſtament;</hi> that it's ſtrange why this is not improved more, againſt the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm</hi> of this time, that ſuch a viſible event of the Scripture is now in being, which was ſo clearly foretold by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> 1500. years ago, with its proper Circumſtances, as to the manner of that <hi>Antichriſtian ſtate,</hi> with its <hi>Riſe, Growth,</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> as is to Admiration ſtill evident to the World, when not the leaſt ſhaddow or appearance of ſo ſtrange Future Emergencies was to be ſeen or could have entred mens Thoughts; to ſhew it only could be revealed to the Church by him, to whom all his Works are known from the Beginning. This I have looked on, as ſuch a <hi>Confirmation</hi> to the Truth of Chriſtianity, that no Miracles in the firſt times of the Church could have more evidence for the ſame; yea if ſuch a party were not in being, both what it now is and in former Ages hath been, it might in another manner ſtagger the Faith of the Saints, to a queſtioning the Truth of the Scripture, than its moſt formidable appearance this day can do. VI. I ſhall but add here, that we know and are ſure the Lord hath reſerved his greateſt works to theſe latter days, wherein his Judgments ſhall be manifeſt; and that one of the moſt eminent Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of his Glory before the cloſe of time ſhall be Conſpicuous in the <hi>fall of Antichriſt,</hi> on whoſe ruines that <hi>Glorious Houſe</hi> which Chriſt is yet to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61707:47"/> have for himſelf both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſhall be prepared and built up; and though this great <hi>Eclipſe</hi> of <hi>Antichriſtian Darkneſs,</hi> ſhould yet more prevail, even over the viſible Profeſſion of the Truth in the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> there is no cauſe to be ſtaggered in the Faith of <hi>Romes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Period,</hi> being near, but to look hereon accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture, as the laſt attempt of that wounded Adverſary, which will be found in the iſſue to have the moſt immediate Connexion with his greateſt downfal, and the <hi>Reviving Glory</hi> of the <hi>Church; for ſtrong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>CHARACTER I. He is one <hi>who hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sence,</hi> and <hi>Impreſſion of this great Study for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to a Confirmed State in Religion,</hi> and is on <hi>higher grounds preſſed to follow the ſame,</hi> than <hi>moſt of the Viſible Church do apprehend;</hi> and ſhould be thus Conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As one to whom the <hi>Glory of the Chriſtian Profeſſion</hi> is in the higheſt Degree dear, and who would have the World ſee, that ſuch as imbrace the ſame, and do moſt fully Adventure on the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God in his Word, are thoſe who walk on the higheſt Principles of true, and <hi>enlightned Reaſon;</hi> yea, who take deeply to Heart that Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which is on all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who deſire to advance the <hi>Repute,</hi> and <hi>Honour of the Truth,</hi> to be in ſuch <hi>Terms</hi> therewith upon its <hi>own Evidence,</hi> that they may know how to Confute and Shame <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> if called thereunto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Who ſee alſo, that ſuch is the State of <hi>fallen Man,</hi> as ſtands in need of all the <hi>Contributions</hi> that can be, not only to ſtrengthen the <hi>Chriſtians Faith,</hi> to bear our againſt the ſtrong Aſſaults of <hi>Infidelity,</hi> but to gain alſo more Credit and <hi>Veneration</hi> to the Truth, with thoſe who are not eaſily dealt with, but by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61707:51"/> ſuch <hi>means</hi> as bear ſome <hi>Congruity to their Natural Light, and Reaſon;</hi> for which end the Lord hath afforded his Miniſterial helps, to render the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the World, and all pretence of Heſitation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Truth more inexcuſable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He alſo ſees, that the moſt important, and <hi>Fundamental Truths</hi> of Chriſtianity, need the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Confirmation in his Faith;</hi> and thoſe who enter into ſo high and diſcriminating a Profeſſion from the reſidue of the World, need to know in what manner they embrace the ſame. He ſees that the <hi>natural Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things</hi> does abſolutely require to have the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> ſure laid, on which ſo great a <hi>ſuperſtructure</hi> muſt reſt, ſo as he judgeth it a <hi>Work by it ſelf,</hi> and to need ſome peculiar retiring his Soul in the moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>receſs,</hi> and Compoſure thereof, to attain <hi>a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs</hi> in the Truth, and to know the ſtrong and <hi>firm Conveyances</hi> of that greateſt <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, in ſuch a manner, as needs not <hi>a new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle</hi> to Confirm the ſame. But he knows that no ſharpneſs of mens <hi>Natural Underſtanding</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Truth can ever attain a true <hi>Reſt, and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of Mind</hi> therein, without an <hi>humble,</hi> and <hi>ſerious Spirit</hi> ſtooping down before the Wiſdom of God, and entring as a <hi>little Child</hi> into his School; and by that humble <hi>Practice,</hi> and Obedience of the Goſpel, there is an undoubted coming up to the greateſt Aſſurance and <hi>cleareſt Demonſtrations of the ſame,</hi> as <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.17.</p>
            <p n="4">4 He knows that as nothing tends more to ſhake Mens Spirits, and ſtagger them about the Truth, than a <hi>Light and Tranſient View</hi> hereof, ſo does the greateſt <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> follow, on the neareſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by a <hi>deep and ſerious Enquiry</hi> about the ſame;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61707:52"/> and he clearly ſees that if ſuch who look but at <hi>a diſtance</hi> on the way of Religion, did but once come to have their Spirits exceed in a more ſerious Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereon, the <hi>firſt view</hi> they ſhould have, could not but be matter of Wonder, and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to think what can ſupport a Soul in ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous a way as the Life and <hi>Practice of Chriſtianity;</hi> Which is ſo viſibly above Nature, and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they muſt do violence to the ſame; wherein they muſt <hi>part with the</hi> Multitude, <hi>and oppoſe themſelves to the ſtrong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61707:52"/> who indeed ſincerely makes the Chriſtian Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not in ſome more continued tranſport of <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment and wondering,</hi> to know that they are ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made for their <hi>Eternal State</hi> in another World, and are among thoſe, on whom the <hi>glorious God</hi> hath choſen to have the exceeding Riches of his Grace ſhewed forth, in the <hi>Regions of Bleſſedneſs</hi> above for ever.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He hath another ſight and proſpect of the <hi>Chriſtian Creed,</hi> than moſt who give an eaſie Aſſent thereunto; and hath his Reaſon ſo dazled with the <hi>Revelation of the Goſpel,</hi> and of the <hi>Wonders</hi> thereof as hath put him to ſuch an Exerciſe as that 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.18. How to Credit his Eyes therewith, the more deep Reflection he hath upon the ſame; <hi>But will God in very deed dwell with men on the Earth?</hi> He judgeth that they, who after ſome fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuſpence, are admitted to ſee the Truth of Chriſtianity, with that <hi>Certainty of its Evidence,</hi> as the greatneſs of ſuch a diſcovery does require; may have ſome reſemblance to that tranſport which the <hi>Angels</hi> had at the <hi>firſt Creation; when the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stars Sung together,</hi> and <hi>the Sons of God ſhouted for Joy;</hi> to ſee themſelves thus, who were brought out of pure nothing, entred into that inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable Light of ſeeing God, and alſo their own bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs in him, in ſo high a degree. So that he accounts it one of the higheſt Attainments of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for a <hi>Chriſtian indeed to believe the Articles of his own Faith,</hi> and have his Soul as fully perſwaded hereof, as of his being; that ſuch a time aſſuredly was, (and is now many Ages ſince paſt,) when the <hi>glorious Redeemer of the Church,</hi> the <hi>ſecond Perſon of the God-head came down from Heaven,</hi> and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61707:53"/> in our Nature; that on him, as <hi>Surety</hi> to Divine Juſtice in the room of the <hi>Elect</hi> Church, was the whole <hi>Guilt,</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> thereof transferred; and in this marvellous way did the Holy God <hi>take Satisfaction to Himſelf, by Himſelf;</hi> that thus our Nature is <hi>exalted,</hi> by the <hi>Incarnation of Chriſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Nature of Angels;</hi> that the time is near when the meaneſt afflicted Chriſtian, ſhall take in no other <hi>Air,</hi> than the Breathings of the <hi>higher Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe</hi> above, and now hath an Eternity of Joy, and Bleſſedneſs before him; that within a very little time he ſhall know this <hi>welcome of</hi> our bleſt Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to his Followers here on the Earth, <hi>Come ye bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of my Father inherit the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61707:53"/> with that <hi>ſolemn Teſtimony of Approbation,</hi> which will be given hereof! And ſince it's ſure theſe <hi>great things</hi> muſt be a part of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith;</hi> can it be ſtrange, that ſuch, as would in that manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe therewith (tho they be not yet ſeen) as no leſs undoubted <hi>Realities</hi> than any preſent <hi>Objects of Senſe,</hi> cannot be eaſily ſatisfied with a low degree of Evidence and Confirmation of their Judgment; but would have their Joy perfected ſo far as this State of Mortality can bear; and ſo find it eaſie to <hi>Rejoice,</hi> and <hi>Glory in Tribulation,</hi> and to weep now for a Seaſon, who are to rejoyce for ever; yea to ſay in the Words of <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> Let them take it all, and enjoy the ſame, ſince he who is their <hi>Life, and Exceeding Joy, Lives and Reigns,</hi> who is Infinitely better to them than all theſe things.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He accounts the <hi>Strengthning of his Faith,</hi> to be ſuch a concern, not only as it is his <hi>Souls Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for all Eternity,</hi> but as the <hi>higheſt way of Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying God here:</hi> That whatever tends to a more full <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the ſame, he reckons alſo one of the greateſt <hi>Additions to his Joy and</hi> Comfort with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in time; and that theſe manifold <hi>Aſſiſtances</hi> (with ſuch <hi>Reduplication</hi> thereof) which the Lord hath himſelf given for this end, are ſuch that <hi>no Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſo rich a Talent ſhould be loſt;</hi> and tho he knows the greateſt <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> of our Faith can add nothing to the <hi>Certainty of Divine Truth</hi> in it ſelf; yet are they thus given in regard of the ſtrong <hi>Trials</hi> of a Chriſtians Life, and of what their <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> ſtand in need of for ſupport.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It's in this Study, he ſees and takes to Heart, how not only the <hi>Condition of Man</hi> in the Earth, but the <hi>Profeſſion of Chriſt</hi> alſo calls for ſuch a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61707:54"/> that he may have <hi>Trials</hi> in that manner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed, that no <hi>viſible refuge</hi> will be found in the leaſt to ſtand by him, but all humane Comfort and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance will fail him, ſo that he muſt needs lay in Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt now in its Seaſon, and be founded thereon with that Aſſurance of Judgment, as is needful for that Day, when he muſt either get through in the alone way of <hi>Believing,</hi> againſt <hi>Sence,</hi> or <hi>Periſh.</hi> And tho no ſuch Attainments of Light can bear out then, without preſent, and immediate <hi>Influences</hi> from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and that it is ſure <hi>according to the Day, ſo muſt the Chriſtians Strength be,</hi> yet does he ſee alſo, the want of an eſtabliſhed Judgment, and of ſome <hi>proper ſtock</hi> laid up of <hi>Aids,</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtances</hi> this way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſharp Storm, is like to make <hi>ſad work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Profeſſours of this Age,</hi> ere the Trials of ſuch a time have done their work.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He ſees alſo how the greateſt <hi>Conteſt,</hi> which in this day in the World, is <hi>betwixt God, and Man,</hi> upon the <hi>Truth and Aſſurance of his Word;</hi> and that the higheſt <hi>Trial,</hi> and <hi>Probation of a Chriſtian,</hi> in which all the Trials of his Life do ſtill meet, may be reſolved here; if they receive <hi>the Teſtimony of God</hi> in his Word as an <hi>abſolute Security</hi> to relie on, yea or not.

            <p n="9">9.

II. <hi>A truly confirmed Chriſtian,</hi> may be thus alſo ſtated, as one who is in the <hi>firſt place</hi> moſt deeply taken up about that <hi>rare Plot of Mans Redemption;</hi> and to ſee theſe <hi>great, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Truths there, not ſingly,</hi> and <hi>apart,</hi> but in that <hi>Harmony, Order,</hi> and <hi>Conſent of all the parts thereof,</hi> as <hi>they are linkt together in this marvellous frame; ſo as to make the whole one entire piece.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no part does in the leaſt interfere with another. Which he finds to be one of the moſt <hi>Principal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations</hi> of this great Myſtery of the Goſpel, which the Lord hath given for <hi>Confirming</hi> his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Faith. And thus in another manner than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, can he now entertain his Soul herewith;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61707:55"/> and have his Joy unſpeakably heightened. 1. To ſee at once the <hi>ruined State of fallen Man,</hi> and what a Flood-gate of all Evil is let looſe on <hi>Adams Race,</hi> not only <hi>Morally in Sin,</hi> but what is <hi>Penal</hi> in the <hi>Woe,</hi> and Miſeries thereof; yea ſuch a State, where all Hope of relief is for ever cut off in the way of Nature, or by any created help; and where the Execution of a <hi>Righteous Sentence</hi> on men for the voluntary Violation of a <hi>Law, Juſt, Holy</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> can be no Impeachment (in the leaſt) of the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God;</hi> But then therewith he does ſee ſuch a relief brought to Light, as can not only anſwer the whole extent of this ruin, but the <hi>Glory of God</hi> more eminently diſplayed therein, than if the <hi>Law</hi> had been <hi>obeyed,</hi> or <hi>abſolutely executed</hi> in its <hi>Penalty</hi> on the whole race of man. Yea, (which makes this more wonderful,) to ſee a higher <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Grace</hi> unto man, now under the Goſpel, than was to <hi>Adam in his Primitive State;</hi> whereby innumerable Chriſtians are made to endure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over <hi>ſtronger Aſſaults,</hi> than broke him even in his <hi>Integrity;</hi> which is a thing ſo marvellous, that the great and Infinite God only could find out and effect it. 2. He does now ſee how clear a Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence and Harmony is here, that he who had no Sin by <hi>Inheſion,</hi> but was Holy, harmleſs, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, ſhould be under the greateſt weight of Sin by <hi>Imputation;</hi> and by the exacteſt Rule of Divine Juſtic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, be made liable to anſwer both the whole <hi>Duty, and full Penalty of the Law;</hi> having, as <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> betwixt the <hi>Creditor</hi> and <hi>Debtor,</hi> put himſelf in his Peoples room, to anſwer the full demands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of both for <hi>Debt, and Duty.</hi> 3. It is here he does ſee that bleſt Conſent and Harmony betwixt the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61707:55"/> ſpotleſs <hi>Juſtice of God,</hi> and his marvellous <hi>Grace;</hi> ſo as his <hi>Love</hi> is to the higheſt glorified, in that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous way, which ſecures the full and compleat Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his <hi>Law,</hi> and all the rights of Inviolable <hi>Juſtice.</hi> 4. Whilſt he is thus dazled with the greatneſs of ſuch a Light, and put to enquire what ſuch a myſtery can mean, he is then further led on to ſee that <hi>rare Plot</hi> and Contrivance of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Reconciliation</hi> between God, and Man, here within time; to be the very <hi>Duplicate,</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpart</hi> of that Eternal Tranſaction, and <hi>Stipulation between the Father and the Son;</hi> and thus ſees what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God hath declared, and <hi>promiſed</hi> in the former to his Church, was firſt <hi>promiſed, and ſecured to our Bleſſed Head in the Covenant of Redemption;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as with a Reverend and Awful Diſtance, ſo with the greateſt Evidence of Light he is made to ſee here theſe reciprocal <hi>Obligations</hi> betwixt them, and <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Truſt</hi> for making good the whole Terms there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the appointed time. 5. He does alſo clearly ſee that rare <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Harmony</hi> of time in theſe <hi>ſignal Periods</hi> of the Revelation of this great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt, which from its more dark Diſcovery, and Dawning, did ſtill more gloriouſly open its ſelf to the <hi>Church;</hi> by a <hi>gradual Light,</hi> and unvailing of the ſame, as the <hi>Sun</hi> in its Courſe unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect day; yea he hath his Faith thus unſpeakably confirmed, to ſee herewith the <hi>Goſpel Church</hi> being ſtill the ſame, whither of <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and how that <hi>Series,</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi> hath yet never been broken off ſince the beginning of a <hi>Church</hi> called forth from the Reſidue of Mankind, ſet apart as a peculiar People for the Lord; where none ever had Right and Priviledge to be Members of the ſame,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61707:56"/> but by <hi>Faith in the Meſſias,</hi> and Profeſſion of their Obedience to his Laws. 6. It is in this <hi>Union and Harmony,</hi> he ſees all the Branches, and Parts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Obedience moſt exactly meer, and terminate, to advance both the greateſt Excellency and <hi>Bleſſedneſs of Man,</hi> and <hi>Aſſimilate</hi> him to the <hi>Bleſſed Image of God.</hi> Yea, how all the Rules, and Precepts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of do ſo entirely Conſpire for this end, as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld to ſee, and admire the <hi>Glorious Nature,</hi> and <hi>Perfections of him,</hi> whoſe Laws theſe are, wherein he does ſo brightly ſhine forth. 7. Nor can he look ſeriouſly herein, and not ſee that ſweet <hi>concord</hi> as a part of this <hi>Harmony,</hi> which is betwixt the <hi>Promiſſory, and Mandatory part of the Goſpel;</hi> ſo as the Chriſtians Comfort is moſt fully eſtabliſhed, and no Duty aboliſhed; but the very Path-road to the moſt full Enjoyments of the Promiſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per way to attain reſt, and tranquillity of Spirit, muſt be ever by taking on the yoke of Chriſt. 8. Yea (to Confirm this entire Union, and Harmony more fully,) he now ſees that exact and marvellous Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence which is betwixt that firſt <hi>Fundamental Promiſe</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the <hi>Event;</hi> betwixt all the Ancient <hi>Figures and Types</hi> of the <hi>Levitical Service,</hi> and the Revelation of <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> in which all theſe did meet as in their proper <hi>Centre,</hi> and now have their full End and <hi>Accompliſhment.</hi> 9. His Confirmation thus grows to ſee that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſent of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and Native reſult here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>to put fallen man in a due poſture towards God, towards his Neighbours, and towards himſelf;</hi> ſo as he may know by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> how to <hi>enjoy God,</hi> and his <hi>Brother,</hi> by <hi>Love;</hi> and thus by <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> to <hi>poſſeſs his own
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61707:56"/> Soul,</hi> and enjoy himſelf. 10. Yea it is in this rare and wonderful frame, he is made to ſee (and no ſight can be like this) that exact correſpondence which is betwixt the <hi>Foundation</hi> and <hi>Superſtructure,</hi> how the whole <hi>Tract of the Goſpel</hi> is but one Entire and Compleat <hi>means to Glorifie God,</hi> and <hi>reſtore fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Man</hi> to the higheſt Bleſſedneſs? How that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Stream of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> does flow from that Fountain Head of an Eternal Decree; which does ſtill run under the Ground, until it <hi>break up</hi> at laſt in the Heart of each Chriſtian, by the <hi>Effectual Call of the Goſpel;</hi> and thus runs down through time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it loſe its ſelf in that unconceivable deep of <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> Thus is it that each Chriſtian might attain ſome higher Degrees of <hi>Confirmation</hi> in <hi>his Faith,</hi> than moſt ſeem either to know, or look after, if he underſtood more how to improve this rare <hi>comparing work of Religion</hi> by ſetting the great Truths and Principles thereof in their Order, and Dependance, ſo as each may be ſeen, in its neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But the more deep Reflection and Enquiry he hath herein, he is the more made to wonder, and finds this one of the great Aſſaults to his Faith? that the <hi>Revelation of Chriſt, and Redemption by his Blood ſhould have no greater effects this day</hi> amongſt men, and that the <hi>Chriſtian World</hi> is not in ſome other manner awakned with the <hi>Glory</hi> of this Light, and preſt after a larger ſpreading and <hi>Diffuſion</hi> of this <hi>higheſt</hi> and <hi>univerſal good</hi> to poor mankind; Yea the more he conſiders this, it doth heigthen his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement to think how mens deſigns in the matter of Duty and Service for the Kingdom of Chriſt, can be ſo <hi>low</hi> within time, whoſe <hi>Deſigns</hi> and <hi>Hopes</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:61707:57"/> in the cloſe thereof are ſo <hi>high</hi> in the matter of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment;</hi> or take ſo little to heart, that the whole <hi>Day of the diſpenſation of the Goſpel,</hi> (amidſt the moſt diſmal Tryals that may fall in therewith,) is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued time wherein we are called to <hi>keep the Feaſt,</hi> and from one Age to another celebrate the ſame, as a perpetual <hi>Jubilee of Joy, and Exultation,</hi> ſince <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover was ſacrificed for us;</hi> but oh how rare a thing ſeems this to be, and how little of that flame and fervency of <hi>Love to our Bleſſed Redeemer is now kindled on his Altar?</hi> Such as might be expected on ſuch wonderful incitements thereto, and which once were in the Church.</p>
            <p>CHARACT. III. Though a <hi>Confirmed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> muſt be ſpecially ſtated as ſuch, one who <hi>knows the Internal part of Religion, and Sealing work of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> on his own Soul, which is not by <hi>words,</hi> but <hi>things</hi> of the higheſt <hi>Truth, Subſtance,</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> yet is he not ſatisfied to know this by <hi>Spiritual Senſe,</hi> until he can ſee the ſame with the furtheſt <hi>Evidence of Light</hi> alſo to his mind; and have no leſs a clear and <hi>judicious Tryal</hi> of this great Myſtery of <hi>Experimental Religion,</hi> for confirmation of his Faith, than to be <hi>ſenſibly</hi> affected with the felt power thereof. And in the <hi>firſt place</hi> why this is neceſſarily requiſite and called for, with reſpect to the <hi>Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed State</hi> of a Chriſtian, may be thus <hi>conſidered,</hi> on ſome <hi>few grounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the things of Religion, which muſt be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced</hi> within time, are ſuch ſublime, and <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Myſteries,</hi> as may be juſt matter of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make men a wonder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. Becauſe this Teſtimony of the Truth of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Religion,</hi> ſhould be underſtood not only as it's of higheſt uſe for Chriſtians <hi>Perſonal Comfort,</hi> and Eſtabliſhment; but with reſpect to the <hi>Publick Int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reſt</hi> of the Church; a ſpecial duty it is to have the <hi>Credit</hi> of this greateſt Teſtimony, and <hi>Seal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrably cleared,</hi> with the furtheſt ſtrength of <hi>harmonious, and argumentative Reaſon,</hi> for ſuch who look but at a diſtance yet thereon; which may not only awaken them to ſome deeper <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion hereof, but conſtrain them to ſee, how no <hi>Natural Science</hi> hath more clear, and firm <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,</hi> than the <hi>Experimental part of Chriſtianity,</hi> (which is the very Life and Soul thereof,) may have to mens <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> tho' they never knew it within themſelves. Yea for this end ſhould ſuch, as have experienced the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Vertue of the Goſpel,</hi> reckon themſelves as <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> who are <hi>judicially obliged</hi> to <hi>put their Seal</hi> thereunto; and is now more called for, in an Age when no particular

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Yea it's ſure herein, that ſuch as take Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to heart, muſt needs look to be put to the <hi>greateſt Tryal of its Certainty,</hi> and ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It doth more ſpecially call for a demonſtrative clearing of the Credit of this Teſtimony, as one of the <hi>Services of Religion,</hi> to promote the Kingdom of Chriſt amongſt men, which ſeems leaſt <hi>improved</hi> of any with reſpect to the <hi>general State</hi> of ſuch who are within the Church, who are ſo great ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the ſame; yea ſhould be judged one of the <hi>great wants</hi> of this day, when Atheiſm is now at ſo aſtoniſhing a height, that it is not more ſtudied to have the <hi>Experimental part of Religion,</hi> (which in it ſelf lies deep and hid, and is a ſecret betwixt God and the Chriſtians Soul,) with ſuch <hi>clearneſs,</hi> and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61707:58"/> by that <hi>manner of Evidence</hi> demonſtrated to the World, as might tend to beget ſome more <hi>Awful Senſe</hi> and Conviction hereof, (when ſuch clear and unanſwerable grounds might be improved for this end) on thoſe who look thereon as ſome ſtrange and dark Riddle, ſo as they could no more deny, or withſtand the <hi>Evidences</hi> hereof, than that they have a <hi>Living Soul which yet they never ſaw;</hi> or could ever be the Object of Human Senſe. And how ſad a proſpect ſhould this give of the greateſt part of the <hi>Chriſtian World?</hi> who not only know nothing of the <hi>True Glory,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Powers of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> but have not the very <hi>Notion,</hi> or any <hi>Senſe</hi> of the reality of ſuch a thing.</p>
            <p>But in the 2d <hi>place</hi> it is thus that each Chriſtian, for being ſolidly confirmed in the Way of Religion, may as <hi>clearly ſee,</hi> as he does <hi>ſenſibly feel,</hi> the Truth of his own Experience, and have his Faith as fully eſtabliſhed by this <hi>inward,</hi> and <hi>great demonſtration</hi> of the things of God, as his <hi>Affections are quickened,</hi> upon ſuch ſtrong, and <hi>demonſtrative grounds</hi> of the <hi>certainty</hi> hereof, as theſe are.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>conſidering</hi> his <hi>preſent,</hi> and <hi>former State;</hi> that not in a dream, but in the moſt deep and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious compoſure of ſpirit, he knows that <hi>once he was blind,</hi> and wholly eſtranged from this Myſtery of <hi>Chriſtian Experience,</hi> which now he does ſee; and once had the ſame <hi>ſentiment</hi> hereof with ſuch who do never at all reflect on the ſame; but no ſooner did the Truth, and <hi>Power of Religion</hi> ſeize on his Soul, than he found himſelf <hi>entred into a new World,</hi> to know the dawnings of this <hi>marvelous Light,</hi> and what belongs to theſe Enjoyments, and <hi>Vital Acts</hi> of Chriſtianity, that have not the leaſt dependance on any <hi>Natural Cauſe.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:61707:59"/>2. By conſidering the <hi>marvelous Superſtructure of Experimental Religion,</hi> which from the <hi>inward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Chriſtians in all Ages,</hi> is ſuch as the <hi>World could not</hi> almoſt <hi>contain the Books, that might be written hereof;</hi> which yet is ſo entirely founded on one, and the <hi>ſame Foundation,</hi> and does in all the <hi>Lines</hi> of this great <hi>Circumference,</hi> ſtill meet in the <hi>ſame Center;</hi> yea thus how entire, and <hi>harmonious</hi> a thing Religion in all the parts thereof is <hi>within</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul, as well as <hi>without;</hi> ſo as every <hi>ſtep in this way</hi> of the <hi>Experience</hi> of the Saints is no gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the dark, but what is by <hi>Line</hi> and by <hi>Rule,</hi> with as ſure, and demonſtrable a connexion with the <hi>External Teſtimony of the Word,</hi> as there is in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> betwixt the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and the <hi>Effect;</hi> which affords a more wonderful aſſiſtance to his Faith, than the greateſt <hi>External Miracles</hi> could ever do; and tho' the Spirit of God does ſometimes in an <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner</hi> reveal himſelf to men, (<hi>as acts of his Soveraign Prerogative</hi> which make no <hi>Rule</hi>) yet with the Eſtabliſhed <hi>Conſtitutions of his Word</hi> does the continued Experience of the Saints moſt harmoniouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever <hi>correſpond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. By conſidering thus alſo the <hi>Being,</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Grace,</hi> not in its <hi>Effects</hi> only, but in its <hi>proper Cauſe and Original,</hi> and how the <hi>Truth of Holineſs</hi> in the Life of a Chriſtian is ſo expreſs a Tranſcript of the Goſpel, in its <hi>External Revelation;</hi> that the <hi>Impreſs</hi> doth not more clearly anſwer <hi>the Seal on the Wax,</hi> than it doth beget the ſame <hi>Form and Image of it ſelf</hi> in ſuch as <hi>believe;</hi> yea alſo that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity it bears to the <hi>ever bleſſed Archetype, as well</hi> as to the <hi>Revealed Rule;</hi> and how bright a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is this of ſo <hi>glorious a Being, and Nature,</hi> to

That this is ſuch an <hi>Argument,</hi> (if they have not in a ſtrange manner forgot,) which hath within theſe 100 <hi>Years</hi> been ſo fully <hi>Anſwered,</hi> and by ſuch an immediate Appearance of God in the <hi>Kingdom of France,</hi> that according to theſe meaſures of Cruelty againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> there, ſo was it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in a <hi>deluge of their own Blood,</hi> yea ſo both the publick ſtate of the Church and Faith of the Saints in the Truth was more deeply rooted; and tho we yet ſee not the end of <hi>theſe wonders,</hi> but the <hi>Dark-ſide</hi> only of the Diſpenſations of ſuch a day, yet do we know this <hi>ſore Rod</hi> on the Church, is but as the <hi>Saw</hi> and <hi>Ax in the Carpenters hand,</hi> who ſhall never <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> that <hi>glorious Work</hi> which Chriſt hath done, and is ſtill further perfecting on the ruins of <hi>Antichriſts Kingdom.</hi>

That the moſt horrid <hi>Turkiſh Slavery</hi> over mens Bodies comes no ſuch length, as that ſtrange <hi>claim</hi> that theſe now make of an <hi>abſolute Empire</hi> over mens <hi>Conſciences</hi> by the <hi>Sword;</hi> and to put them to ſuch a <hi>Tribute</hi> of their Obedience, that they

            <p>CHARACT. VII. A truly <hi>Confirmed Chriſtian</hi> may in the <hi>laſt place</hi> be herein alſo conſidered, as ſuch whoſe <hi>Faith being oft tryed</hi> through all theſe <hi>Stages of Chriſtianity</hi> he hath been taken; hath ſome <hi>proper Record</hi> of the moſt <hi>choice,</hi> and <hi>ſignal Confirmations of his Life,</hi> to improve the ſame not only for his <hi>own ſupport</hi> in that <hi>laſt warfare of death,</hi> but for <hi>ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Faith of others;</hi> wherein he does thus judge, 1. That there could be no true ſupport or relief from <hi>Religion</hi> here in the Earth, if it cannot bear out then. And that <hi>Death</hi> is the great <hi>To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

He rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons each real Chriſtian, by his Profeſſion then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged and accountable, (even by ſome <hi>explicite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Teſtimony,</hi>) to put to his <hi>Seal that God is True,</hi> and bear the ſame witneſs with his <hi>laſt</hi> and <hi>dying breath</hi> to the <hi>Truth of Chriſtianity,</hi> which he gave in the whole courſe of his Life; and of that <hi>joy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence,</hi> and <hi>aſſurance of Mind,</hi> which he hath found, and now hath in the way of Truth: So as to preſs the ſame on his <hi>deareſt Relations,</hi> as their alone true Intereſt. 3. He ſees alſo, how <hi>honourable</hi> it is for the Lord, that ſuch whoſe Faith hath been oft <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> (and when thus with <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Admiration</hi> he can look back on the moſt preſſing and conſpicuous
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61707:70"/> 
               <hi>Conflicts</hi> of time,) ſhould have it their laſt work to pay in ſome <hi>Tribute of Praiſe,</hi> unto <hi>him,</hi> whoſe <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Promiſe</hi> unto them did yet <hi>never fail.</hi> 4. He accounts the more <hi>weighty Tryals</hi> he hath been carried thorow in his Chriſtian warfare, do both add more to this <hi>Service,</hi> and impart more to the <hi>value</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Teſtimony.</hi> 5. He judgeth this one ſpecial way, and advantage, whereby <hi>one Generation might declare the Truth and Faithfulneſs of God unto another, in a Family Line and Relation, to ſhew</hi> forth thus that the <hi>Lord is upright;</hi> that <hi>he is their Rock,</hi> and <hi>with him is no Unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Yea which ſhould be matter of unſpeakable Joy, when now in his <hi>turn</hi> he can ſay that ſuch hath the Lord been to him; what were <hi>Davids</hi> dying Words, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.14. <hi>Who hath delivered my Soul out of all diſtreſs,</hi> how that in no trouble, or <hi>exigence</hi> of his Life, he was ever left without a <hi>door of Hope,</hi> and thus alſo with <hi>Caleb, Joſh.</hi> 14.10. To give in ſome ſuch <hi>witneſs for God,</hi> 
               <q>I am now near the <hi>cloſe of time,</hi> and do <hi>teſtifie,</hi> that the <hi>Word of his Truth, and Promiſe,</hi> he hath ſurely <hi>accompliſhed;</hi> which hath brought <hi>me ſafe</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably through,</hi> when ſuch as did diſtruſt the ſame by <hi>misbelief,</hi> and ſought after another <hi>refuge,</hi> found all <hi>their Confidences fail.</hi>
               </q> 6. And knowing likewiſe how great a <hi>ſuprizal Death</hi> may be; and that ſuch as have <hi>ſhined</hi> in their day, may yet ſet under a <hi>cloud</hi> and go ſilent off the <hi>Stage;</hi> he judgeth it the more needful to have ſuch a <hi>piece of his dying work prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> as one of the choiceſt <hi>Legacies</hi> he can bequeath to his Surviving Friends, in a <hi>ſeaſon</hi> when it hath uſually the greateſt advantage of <hi>weight</hi> and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: it being ſtill qualified with <hi>Chriſtian Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Humble Sobriety;</hi> ſo as all may ſee its whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61707:71"/> is to <hi>commend</hi> to mens Conſcience the <hi>way of Truth</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs</hi> and not themſelves, and thus direct it, for the <hi>proper uſe,</hi> and improvement of their neareſt Relations. I know it may be ſtrange to ſome, what is ſpoke upon this Head; but as it's ſure the preſent day hath its <hi>Duty,</hi> and each time of out Life hath ſome <hi>proper work,</hi> ſo I humbly judge, that this ſeems to fall in, as <hi>the laſt Service of a dying Chriſtian to his Generation,</hi> to <hi>deliver off his hand the Truth</hi> which he had received and hath oft <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> with his <hi>Confirmatory Seal</hi> and <hi>Teſtimon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And now is it in ſome more than ordinary way called for in this hour of great darkneſs, when if the Security of the <hi>Abſolute Promiſes</hi> ſtood not good to the Church, we might fear <hi>Religion</hi> might quickly wear out, and <hi>Truth</hi> periſh from the Earth; and as ſo ſolemn and weighty a thing ſhould it be managed with much humble Prudence, ſo that it may be judged that there is no ſerious, and <hi>obſerving</hi> Chriſtian, but hath ſome peculiar <hi>ingagements</hi> under which they find themſelves held even beyond others, yea ſome ſuch <hi>Singular Confirmations</hi> in the <hi>Journal</hi> of their Life, that ſhould not be eaſie to <hi>hide</hi> under the ground; where the <hi>ſtrengthning of others</hi> hereby is concerned; and that ſuch ſhould not then leave the <hi>Croſs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> at a <hi>loſs,</hi> or part therewith without their <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> which hath left them at ſo gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>at an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</hi> And though this is not to offer particular <hi>Rules</hi> in ſuch a Duty, but that <hi>Chriſtian Wiſdom</hi> muſt direct herein, as the preſent <hi>Caſe is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated,</hi> yet might it be hoped, were this more taken to Heart, it ſhould be a ſingular <hi>means</hi> to make more deep Impreſſions of mens <hi>dying Work</hi> on their Spirits. Even whilſt they are in <hi>health,</hi> to <hi>excite</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:61707:71"/> their ſurviving Friends, and to keep <hi>Religion</hi> thus <hi>alive</hi> in a <hi>Family ſtate,</hi> and <hi>Relation,</hi> and gain a more venerable <hi>reſpect</hi> to the ſame on mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; yea to <hi>fix</hi> alſo ſtronger <hi>ingagements</hi> on the <hi>ſucceeding offspring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus is preſented here a ſhort <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>ſolid and judicious Work of Chriſtian Confirmation in the Truth,</hi> under theſe foregoing <hi>Characters,</hi> to ſhew how rare an attainment of Religion this is, yea to preſent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſpecial <hi>Series</hi> and <hi>Scale</hi> of the greateſt <hi>ſteps in this Confirmatory work,</hi> by which it ſhould be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. And none of theſe may be parted from other, though ſome be of an higher, and more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute uſe for ſuch an end. And if it ſhould be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted here, What needs any ſuch expenſe of <hi>time,</hi> or <hi>pains</hi> in this Caſe, when it's ſure the Eſſential Truths of the Goſpel are not <hi>queſtioned,</hi> and that without <hi>internal evidence</hi> of the Spirit, no external means of this kind can be of uſe. I know that it's the alone work of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to beget a <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Faith;</hi> without which the furtheſt <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Objective Evidence,</hi> though backed with a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſpenſation of <hi>External Miracles,</hi> could never bear Chriſtians out, either as to <hi>Duty,</hi> or <hi>Comfort,</hi> in their paſſage thorow time; yea nothing is in the leaſt here to ſubject the <hi>Credit</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> to mens <hi>Rational Comprehenſion,</hi> but rather tends to enervate wholly the ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ngth of any ſuch <hi>Tenet,</hi> and take off all pretence for the ſame: But it's ſure alſo, I muſt quit all <hi>ſolid Security</hi> in the way of Religion, and any clear founding in the <hi>Light and Certainty of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or admit theſe things as undeniable, 1. That ſupernatural <hi>Faith</hi> is the moſt <hi>highly rational Light</hi> that's within time. And that none who profeſs the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61707:72"/> Name of Chriſt can be of ſo low a <hi>ſize,</hi> as ſhould not be preſſed, and <hi>excited</hi> to be much about this <hi>Ground-work</hi> of knowing the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of their Profeſſion upon its <hi>own Evidence;</hi> yea are thus called <hi>as new born Babes to drink in the ſincere Milk of the Word,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. Which, as it's clearly in the <hi>Original,</hi> is the <hi>rational Milk of the Word,</hi> to be thus received no leſs on <hi>Conviction,</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> of the Judgment, than with the out going of their <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi> 2. That as it's not conceiveable how a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>firm Aſſent</hi> can be to <hi>Divine Truth,</hi> but on its <hi>known Certainty,</hi> ſo here is no <hi>reſolving</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Faith on the ſtrongeſt <hi>rational Evidences</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which muſt ſtill be <hi>reſolved</hi> on the <hi>Teſtimony of God,</hi> made clear and <hi>evident to them</hi> to be ſuch. 3. It is ſure alſo, the Lord hath not given ſo large a meaſure of theſe <hi>Grounds,</hi> and <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> of his Truth with ſuch <hi>redoubled Arguments</hi> of that kind, to be of ſo ſmall regard, as is with moſt. But for ſome <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>univerſal uſe</hi> hereof to the whole Church, and knew how needful ſuch <hi>Aſſiſtances</hi> to the Faith of his People would be, whilſt they are on the Earth. 4. That theſe <hi>means,</hi> which tend moſt convincingly to found a <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Aſſurance</hi> in the Judgment, are the proper <hi>Vehicle of the Spirit of God,</hi> by which his <hi>ſealing Work,</hi> ſhould be both ſought and expected; nor can I judge how the Credit, and uſe hereof ſhould be ſo ſmall, and not on the ſame Ground quit any <hi>External Ordinance</hi> of the Goſpel; which without the Spirit of the Lord can never profit, nor how we ſhould expect and ſuit his <hi>Confirming Work</hi> on the Soul, when theſe greateſt Confirming Means, which he hath given to the Church, have no juſt weight: But oh! how wonderful a Teacher is the Holy Ghoſt, when ſuch ordinary means fail, and are <hi>inacceſſible,</hi> by furniſhing his People then with theſe ſtrongeſt <hi>Arguments of Love, and Power,</hi> who having had but ſmall <hi>Meaſures of Light,</hi> yet were not unfaithful to improve the ſmalleſt degree of ſuch a Talent? 5. Yea ſo great a thing is it, to attain a ſolid <hi>Faith of Things</hi> wholly <hi>remote from our Senſe,</hi> and ſo far <hi>above</hi> the reach, and <hi>Apprehenſion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or to have an abſolute reliance on an <hi>inviſible Refuge,</hi> for our preſent and Eternal State, as no common Aſſent
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61707:72"/> can anſwer, when the very <hi>reſt and quiet of the Soul</hi> muſt needs lie in the ſure and firm Perſwaſion hereof. 6. It is too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible alſo how little the <hi>Practical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of ſuch a mean</hi> hath yet been <hi>eſſaied in the Church,</hi> tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all who are members thereof might no leſs know the <hi>Strength and Firmneſs of the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Faith</hi> by its <hi>own Evidence,</hi> than the <hi>General Articles</hi> of Religion. The moſt uſual inſtructing work lies almoſt wholly about the <hi>Noetick part of Divinity,</hi> there ſeems not that ſerious regard to preſs the <hi>Dianoetick</hi> part hereof on Mens Conſcience, as if this were to be reſtrained to a few who are more Knowing, Learned, and of an Inquiſitive Spirit about the <hi>rational Certainty</hi> of the Truth, and for whom theſe choice and abundant helps of this kind, which are in this Age, ſeem more peculiarly directed. It's ſure, that the Chriſtian Faith in the <hi>firſt-times</hi> did remarkably then ſpread, and prevail, <hi>by theſe clear</hi> Evidences <hi>hereof to the Judgment, made Effectual by</hi> the Spirit of God, <hi>more than by</hi> extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miracles. Nor knew they otherwiſe wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Yea is it not ſure, (tho it ſeem little underſtood,) that the <hi>prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Grounds,</hi> and <hi>Evidences</hi> of our Faith are not only as to their <hi>End demonſtrative</hi> of the Truth, and Divinity of the Scripture, but are upon the <hi>Matter,</hi> ſuch <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> alſo which moſt natively reſult from the ſame by infallible <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence;</hi> and are thus to be accounted not as <hi>Humane,</hi> but <hi>Divine Arguments,</hi> given us by the Spirit of God. 8. I ſhall but further add, how ſuch as do ſeriouſly <hi>ponder</hi> things, will find this <hi>Demonſtration</hi> to be no more important than clear, <hi>that to be a Confirmed Chriſtian, and a Confirmed Proteſtant are Convertible Terms;</hi> and that if they that are under that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Bondage, and <hi>Darkneſs of Popery</hi> were but once <hi>awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> to ſee the <hi>Truth,</hi> and Certainty of the Chriſtian Faith, by its <hi>Intrinſick</hi> and <hi>Objective Evidence,</hi> and taken off that brutiſh Credulity, and Dependance on the alone Credit of others herein, it might be ſaid the <hi>ſtrongeſt Engine</hi> to hold up that Profeſſion were then broke, and we ſhould ſee the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> and <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> to be of ſuch <hi>full,</hi> and <hi>perſpicuous Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
